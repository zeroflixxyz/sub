Enjoy!

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:26.942
MAN 1: Sorry, l just can't give you
that kind of information.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.611
l'll do anything else. l just can't do that.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.823
l can't betray my country. l won't.

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:35.743
This country gave me everything.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.495
Oh, God. Just keep him away from me.

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:41.040
Please. Don't let him near me.

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:43.375
Oh, no! Oh, God!

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:46.962
Come on, baby. Just relax into it.
Let Godzilla do his thing.

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.966
MAN 2: Come on. This is wrong
on so many levels. You in or not?

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:52.259
And get cheated again?

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:56.388
What? No, the Pooch may lie,
the Pooch may steal, the Pooch may--

00:00:56.556 --> 00:01:00.267
-Refer to himself in the third person?
-Occasionally. But the Pooch won't cheat.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:03.020
Well, the Pooch can relax.
I was worried about Cougar.

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:05.272
POOCH:
Yeah, right. lt's always the quiet ones.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.151
What? lt's Blind Man's Bluff.
High card wins.

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:10.986
How in the hell can a man cheat you?

00:01:12.113 --> 00:01:13.322
POOCH:
Cards.

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:19.495
Feel like l got something here.
I got something.

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:22.081
Queen, king, jack. Queen, king, jack.
All right.

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:24.166
One, two, three, go.

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:38.263
I got a great, great feeling
about this one.

00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:44.269
-Your mama had a great feeling last night.
-Oh, that was a mama joke.

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:47.231
What? All right.

00:01:47.398 --> 00:01:49.775
-All right, let's go.
JENSEN: Okay, it's a game.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:52.319
All right, l will raise you.

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:55.656
-You don't wanna do that.
JENSEN: Oh, no?

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:58.075
-Got this piece off that Honduran general?
-Yes.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.204
Guess what? I'm definitely in.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.208
-Let's go.
-All right.

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:07.417
JENSEN:
Whoa!

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:11.046
-Should even me up.
-How many do you have?

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:12.381
What is going on here?

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:13.966
Coug, it's your bet.

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:15.551
MAN:
Hey, losers!

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:18.887
It's time.

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:37.072
We got a drug and arms dealer
named Fadhil...

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.118
...running a homegrown terrorist assembly
line out by the Madre de Dios River basin.

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:45.747
We find it, we paint it for a laser-targeted
bomb, we get the hell out.

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:47.207
No muss, no fuss.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.042
For that, they need us?

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.879
You'd rather take on 50 dudes
with AK's?

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:09.313
All right, l got eyes on Monsieur Fadhil.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.398
-Paint it.
POOCH: Showtime, fellas.

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:14.443
Go ahead and call me Michelangelo.

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:18.197
JENSEN: Dropkick, this is Pinball.
Request fire mission.

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:22.075
The target is lased, and you are clear
to make a run from north to south. Over.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.120
PlLOT: Roger, Pinball,
target acquired and locked.

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:28.832
Be advised, ETA fireworks,
zero eight Mikes.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.834
Roger, we'll break out the earplugs.

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:39.551
Boss?

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:44.806
CLAY:
They're using kids as mules.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.645
-Call it in.
-We have children at target site.

00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:52.898
Repeat, we have eyes on children
at target site. Please advise.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.524
MAN:
Acknowledged. Maintain position.

00:03:54.692 --> 00:03:56.944
Maintain position?
What is he talking about?

00:03:57.111 --> 00:03:59.655
We strongly recommend cancellation
of payload delivery.

00:04:00.114 --> 00:04:02.449
Your orders stand. Prep for extraction.

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:05.661
Cougar.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:09.915
Dropkick, this is Pinball.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.417
Equipment has suffered
catastrophic system failure.

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:14.962
Am calling an on-site abort.

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:18.548
Well, that was just stupid.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:20.968
Is this Mission Controller?

00:04:21.135 --> 00:04:22.719
This is Max, Colonel Clay.

00:04:23.137 --> 00:04:26.682
No one uses names on comms.
This is a secure military channel.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.934
-Really?
-Goddamn it, listen to me.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.852
There are children on site.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.854
And you think l didn't know that?

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:35.691
We locked coordinates
the moment you painted.

00:04:35.858 --> 00:04:37.526
Delivery will occur on schedule.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.236
-Have a super day.
-You can't--

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:42.531
Shit! Jensen, contact the plane directly.
Call an abort.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.534
I'm trying. He's jamming us.
There's nothing I can do.

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:49.663
There's something we can do.

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.082
All right, here it is.
Five against the fortress.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.295
We got maybe, what, eight minutes before
an airstrike sets the world on fire.

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.088
Plenty of time.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:04:59.381
I'll drive.

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:28.785
Us against 50 dudes with AK's, huh?

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:41.048
Jensen, Pooch, get a truck for the kids.
Rest, out in five.

00:05:41.215 --> 00:05:45.719
-Airstrike in four and change, ladies!
-Be out in four. Rally point. On me.

00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:48.096
PlLOT:
Three minutes to target.

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:03.653
Come on, let's go!
Out you go. Come on, kids.

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:09.993
-Okay, you go over here with him.
ROQUE: Come on, mama. Come on.

00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:13.330
I got this. Get them out.

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:16.792
All right, who's your papi? Let's go
this way. Let's go. Come on, let's go.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.047
POOCH:
Ah.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.965
-No.
-Yeah.

00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:25.258
-Really?
-Why not?

00:06:25.426 --> 00:06:26.843
-Can you?
-Of course.

00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:28.595
Okay.

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:36.478
Ladies.

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:41.858
Up you get. Up you get.

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:46.405
POOCH: Clay, we got
the kids. Rally point, two minutes.

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:53.495
Max sent you, didn't he?

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:59.126
I won't commit to his plan, he does this.

00:06:59.293 --> 00:07:03.171
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.
You let him go, l let you live.

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:08.051
Come here, son.
Come here, son. Walk to me.

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.430
Attaboy.

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:14.558
POOCH:
Clay, get the hell out. We gotta go, now.

00:07:14.725 --> 00:07:16.184
He'll kill you too, you know.

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:25.777
PlLOT:
Target is locked. T minus 20 seconds.

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:29.448
Oh, you stop for coffee in there?

00:07:36.497 --> 00:07:38.331
What kind of blast radius
we looking at?

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:43.253
Okay, Pooch, l need you
to make this bus go a little faster.

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:45.714
-Everybody, hold on to something.
-Like right now!

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:15.160
I got it, I got it!

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:16.536
CLAY:
There we go, Pooch!

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:23.084
Whew.

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:31.176
MAN 1: Pinball, this is Chopper 3.
Prepare for extraction.

00:08:33.137 --> 00:08:36.264
My favorite part was
when we were completely on fire.

00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:38.600
But the shootout, that was good times.

00:08:43.105 --> 00:08:44.523
CLAY:
There she blows.

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:46.107
Well done.

00:08:46.275 --> 00:08:47.526
Let's go, let's go.

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:50.529
-All right, everyone together.
-Come on, let's go.

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:52.113
JENSEN:
There you go. Good job.

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:56.409
MAN 2: Sir, there's not enough room
for your team and them.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.954
Then it's them.

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:01.957
-Let's go, guys.
POOCH: All right, here we go.

00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:05.126
CLAY:
Watch your heads.

00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:16.721
You keep your bear.
You keep him safe. Okay?

00:09:18.599 --> 00:09:20.809
Adios. Get them out of here.

00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:38.493
Those are some cute little buggers.
Hope they make it to the court martial.

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:40.662
What is that? You hear that?

00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:46.334
Guys, this is bad.

00:09:46.877 --> 00:09:48.712
MAN 1:
Max, Cobra One, Bandit locked.

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:51.047
MAN 2:
Understood.

00:09:51.465 --> 00:09:54.843
Cobra One, kill Bandit.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.763
No!

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:47.062
That's supposed to be us.

00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:52.233
WOMAN: Protests today in front of
the American Embassy, a violent response...

00:10:52.401 --> 00:10:55.570
...to the deaths of 25 Bolivian children
killed during the operation.

00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:57.864
Let me be perfectly clear.

00:10:58.032 --> 00:11:03.244
In no way were these men acting
under orders from the U.S. government.

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:11.252
Is there gonna be some kind
of ceremony for them?

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:17.967
Where's the ring?

00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:01.720
DOLL:
l love you, Mommy. You're so pretty.

00:12:04.306 --> 00:12:05.348
l love you, Mommy.

00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:30.790
What are you doing? No, no, no!

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:34.419
-Jeez. He's gonna get murdered.
-Come on, come on, come on.

00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:45.180
This is disgusting.
All right, l'm officially disgusted by us.

00:12:45.347 --> 00:12:47.599
-And you lost again.
-We lost again.

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:50.185
-No, you put the bet down.
-You gave me the money.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.438
Yeah, and that was stupid of me,
wasn't it?

00:12:55.816 --> 00:12:59.027
I mean, could this get any more sleazy?

00:13:03.657 --> 00:13:05.825
I suppose if we started drinking.

00:13:05.993 --> 00:13:07.577
You're not--? You're not drinking?

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:14.209
Come on, get him in there!

00:13:24.845 --> 00:13:25.887
Thank you.

00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:34.687
I found a guy online who says
he can trade intel on Max for cash.

00:13:34.855 --> 00:13:37.732
-All we gotta do is make a little money.
-We don't have money.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:42.237
We're gonna go PayPal-ing some kid
in a basement who's most likely lying?

00:13:42.404 --> 00:13:44.656
You were there.
You know the man tried to kill us.

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:47.242
The man did kill us, Clay.

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:52.747
No, we gotta stay focused. All right?
On the mission.

00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:58.044
Get money, get clean passports, get back
to stateside without anybody noticing.

00:13:58.212 --> 00:14:00.880
-Didn't even see what he looks like.
-We heard his voice.

00:14:01.048 --> 00:14:03.341
A man with a voice
is a man with a throat.

00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:05.426
Come on. Clay, just look around you.

00:14:05.594 --> 00:14:09.848
Do you think we're in a position
to actually take on some ClA super spook?

00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:11.432
-Roque.
-lt's a hell of a plan.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.602
You know what? Pooch can set up
over there by the taco stand.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.522
Jensen can set up communications
right there by the hookers.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.482
-Captain.
-Yo! Yo.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.569
You're not a soldier anymore.

00:14:23.237 --> 00:14:25.613
You're not a soldier. All right?

00:14:27.783 --> 00:14:30.702
Clay, for chrissakes,
you're losing the men.

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:36.875
-The men are fine.
-Yeah, well, you're losing me. All right?

00:14:37.793 --> 00:14:41.129
He won, we lost. Just get us home.

00:14:44.466 --> 00:14:46.134
Can you do that?

00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:56.162
How's your steak?

00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:58.498
Meaty.

00:16:02.252 --> 00:16:04.003
You want a bite?

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.007
Maybe later.

00:16:10.302 --> 00:16:12.178
Okay.

00:16:22.022 --> 00:16:23.523
Do I know you?

00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:25.984
Relax, Papi.

00:16:29.738 --> 00:16:31.531
Do I not look relaxed?

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:34.200
No.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.499
Think we can change that?

00:16:47.881 --> 00:16:51.551
Wow, it's everything a girl can dream of.

00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:56.597
Do you have a bathroom?

00:16:56.765 --> 00:16:59.684
No, I specifically requested
the only hotel room in the world...

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:01.310
...that doesn't have a bathroom.

00:17:01.895 --> 00:17:04.939
Are you trying to turn a yes into a no?

00:17:05.607 --> 00:17:07.734
Oh. Thank you.

00:17:16.952 --> 00:17:18.786
So, what brings you to Bolivia?

00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:20.955
Cruise ship.

00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:23.374
We're a landlocked country.

00:17:23.542 --> 00:17:25.793
Well, it's an amazing cruise ship.

00:17:32.092 --> 00:17:33.468
Where were we now?

00:17:36.597 --> 00:17:38.765
Well, l think you were about to tell me...

00:17:39.516 --> 00:17:41.142
...how you enjoy following me.

00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:44.103
You saw me, didn't you?

00:17:44.271 --> 00:17:45.354
I did.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.442
I bet you didn't see me
on Mercado Street.

00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:56.949
I have a business proposition
for you, Clay.

00:17:57.117 --> 00:17:59.452
Oops. What happened to your accent?

00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:01.662
Oops.

00:18:07.002 --> 00:18:08.169
I don't wanna hurt you.

00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:10.838
-You're not going to.
-Oh, yes, l am.

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:18.322
-Hi.
-Hi.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:43.139
What do you want?

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.141
I can help you find Max.

00:19:46.643 --> 00:19:48.436
I'm listening.

00:20:00.824 --> 00:20:02.283
How did you know we were alive?

00:20:02.451 --> 00:20:04.952
I counted the number of teeth
in the chopper wreckage.

00:20:05.913 --> 00:20:08.372
Plus you guys aren't exactly subtle.

00:20:09.249 --> 00:20:12.835
Here's the deal.
I get you and your men back in the States.

00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:14.879
In exchange, you get Max for me.

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:18.257
-What's the catch, lady?
-lt's pretty much a suicide mission.

00:20:19.968 --> 00:20:22.136
Why should I trust you?

00:20:22.846 --> 00:20:26.474
Because if l were lying, I wouldn't have
used the words "suicide mission."

00:20:30.854 --> 00:20:33.231
Just meet me here tomorrow.

00:20:34.274 --> 00:20:36.317
And bring your boys.

00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:38.486
-Goodbye.
-Hey.

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:45.493
If you're lying to me, l'll kill you.

00:20:46.536 --> 00:20:48.246
It was nice meeting you too.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.665
CLAY:
Yes, it was.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:13.145
JENSEN: l'm sorry we're late.
There was a party at the doll factory.

00:21:13.522 --> 00:21:14.772
It was Pepito's birthday.

00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:16.565
POOCH: Really?
JENSEN: Yeah.

00:21:22.364 --> 00:21:25.199
So she wanted to meet in a cemetery.

00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:28.035
Because that's not,
like, foreboding at all.

00:21:28.537 --> 00:21:30.997
-Am I the only one that sees this shirt?
-No.

00:21:32.374 --> 00:21:33.833
Oh, it's my niece's soccer team.

00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:37.503
Eight and under.
I checked their scores online and l--

00:21:38.255 --> 00:21:39.714
What?

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.550
They're in the playoffs.

00:21:43.343 --> 00:21:45.011
CLAY:
What do you have on her?

00:21:45.387 --> 00:21:47.388
JENSEN:
Besides a pant-busting crush?

00:21:48.181 --> 00:21:49.974
Her company file is blank.

00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:54.770
CIA has a standing kill order on her.
As does Hamas, Sinn Féin.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.482
Pretty much everyone with the exception of
PETA wants this chick amscrayed.

00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:03.654
You thinking clear on this? Because every
time you mess up, it's because of a woman.

00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:05.406
-Name one time that l--
-Amber.

00:22:05.574 --> 00:22:09.076
-Amber's husband was the problem.
-Her husband wasn't the one who shot you.

00:22:09.244 --> 00:22:10.870
-Only in the leg.
-What about Emma?

00:22:11.038 --> 00:22:14.790
-Doesn't count. I didn't sleep with Emma.
-Because she put a bomb in your car!

00:22:14.958 --> 00:22:18.502
I admit, that did take a little of the romance
out of the relationship.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.006
Yeah. And now this chick shows up and--
What's her name, Aisha?

00:22:22.174 --> 00:22:25.676
And well, she burns down our hotel.

00:22:25.844 --> 00:22:27.094
I'm clear, Roque.

00:22:27.262 --> 00:22:30.556
ROQUE: Well, you better be,
because l ain't getting killed by no girl.

00:22:30.724 --> 00:22:33.434
It's been a long time
since anyone called me a girl.

00:22:37.939 --> 00:22:40.107
She put a bomb in your car?

00:22:40.317 --> 00:22:41.442
She was volatile.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:46.447
Aisha, this is Jensen,
Pooch, Roque, Cougar.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.407
Really? Heh.

00:22:51.286 --> 00:22:55.873
Gentlemen, in 97 hours,
Max will be in Miami.

00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:59.210
He travels in an armored column
with at least 30 private security...

00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:01.045
...armed to the teeth.

00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:03.839
You have a better shot
at kidnapping the president.

00:23:05.592 --> 00:23:09.470
Good news for you is I have the power
to get you guys back in the U.S...

00:23:09.638 --> 00:23:12.348
...and fund the entire op as you see fit.

00:23:12.516 --> 00:23:14.517
You get Max and we're square.

00:23:14.684 --> 00:23:17.645
And why should we believe you?

00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:22.400
Because I'm the first person you've met
who even admits he exists.

00:23:23.944 --> 00:23:26.987
Listen, you guys can all stay here
in Bolivia and rot.

00:23:27.155 --> 00:23:30.157
Or you can go home and get revenge
on the man that framed you.

00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:32.159
It's your choice.

00:23:32.994 --> 00:23:34.328
Colonel?

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.289
Don't call me that.
We're not soldiers anymore.

00:23:37.457 --> 00:23:39.250
POOCH:
Okay, you know that if we do this...

00:23:39.418 --> 00:23:42.586

...we are waging a war
against the Central lntelligence Agency.

00:23:44.131 --> 00:23:45.881
They started it.

00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:56.684
MAX:
Okay, here's what I'm hearing.

00:23:56.852 --> 00:24:01.313
I'm hearing, "No." I'm hearing, "Leave."
I'm hearing, "l'm sorry."

00:24:01.481 --> 00:24:05.109
-ls that what l'm hearing?
-We cannot do what you ask. l'm sorry!

00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:08.779
MAX: Tell me, Nabil, is this a moral issue
or a financial issue?

00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:10.030
-A moral issue.
-Really?

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:12.825
You morally object to this deal?

00:24:12.993 --> 00:24:16.829
-Yes, I'm sorry. Please, leave.
-Okay, so that is what l'm hearing.

00:24:16.997 --> 00:24:19.999
Now I want you to listen to me,
listen carefully...

00:24:20.167 --> 00:24:21.834
...because I want you to hear this.

00:24:22.294 --> 00:24:23.544
Wade?

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.050
What is this? What are you doing?

00:24:31.219 --> 00:24:32.595
No, please!

00:24:43.356 --> 00:24:45.566
What the hell was that?

00:24:46.067 --> 00:24:47.568
WADE:
You gave me the nod.

00:24:47.736 --> 00:24:50.988
A hit-him-in-the-face nod,
not a throw-him-off-the-roof nod.

00:24:53.241 --> 00:24:55.409
-l thought that's what you wanted.
-At most...

00:24:55.577 --> 00:24:57.745
...at most,
that was a break-his-fingers nod.

00:24:57.913 --> 00:25:01.290
Jesus, Wade.
The man was a scientific genius.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:05.628
Granted, his weight signaled certain
impulse-control issues...

00:25:06.379 --> 00:25:10.382
...but that's no reason
to throw his fat ass off 57 floors.

00:25:10.592 --> 00:25:12.218
Sorry.

00:25:14.137 --> 00:25:19.767
I think I speak for everyone here
when l say your actions were excessive.

00:25:19.935 --> 00:25:23.437
And yes, more than just a little wasteful.

00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:29.193
But then, it does seem
to have had the desired effect.

00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:32.530
-l'll tell you what, throw baldy off next.
-No, please. Wait.

00:25:33.657 --> 00:25:36.617
We have a different moral perspective
than our late colleague.

00:25:37.118 --> 00:25:39.495
I need one to test and four to use.

00:25:39.663 --> 00:25:41.247
Four snukes?

00:25:41.623 --> 00:25:43.040
We would need much money.

00:25:46.419 --> 00:25:48.796
You will have much money.

00:26:29.838 --> 00:26:32.172
Welcome back to the land of the living.

00:26:37.345 --> 00:26:38.762
How do you wanna begin?

00:26:39.848 --> 00:26:41.849
We're gonna go bird hunting.

00:27:30.565 --> 00:27:34.193
MAX: lt's a sonic de-materializer.
Better known as a snuke.

00:27:34.736 --> 00:27:37.529
For the 21 st-century green terrorist.

00:27:38.031 --> 00:27:39.365
Pure destruction.

00:27:40.075 --> 00:27:41.742
No pollution.

00:27:46.414 --> 00:27:48.248
WADE:
So who are we selling them to?

00:27:49.209 --> 00:27:51.627
Chinese extremists, PLF,
the frigging French Basques.

00:27:51.795 --> 00:27:54.838
As long as they have the right price
and are willing to use it.

00:27:55.006 --> 00:27:57.174
No stockpiling, no deterrence.

00:27:57.342 --> 00:28:00.427
It's like giving a handgun
to a 6-year-old, Wade.

00:28:00.595 --> 00:28:02.262
You don't know how it's gonna end...

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:05.265
...but you're pretty sure
it's gonna make the papers.

00:28:05.975 --> 00:28:07.017
Another war.

00:28:07.227 --> 00:28:09.687
Well, what do you believe in, Wade?

00:28:09.854 --> 00:28:12.856
I'm guessing shotguns and big titties.

00:28:13.024 --> 00:28:15.359
I also enjoy air shows and beer.

00:28:19.614 --> 00:28:20.906
We're saving the country...

00:28:21.074 --> 00:28:24.159
...doing something for the benefit of
the United States of America.

00:28:24.327 --> 00:28:26.286
I was born in Quebec.

00:28:26.788 --> 00:28:30.124
Okay. Then we're saving North America.

00:28:32.961 --> 00:28:35.295
Oops. Sorry.

00:28:39.175 --> 00:28:41.301
Let me have your weapon, Wade.

00:29:20.133 --> 00:29:22.342
Base 1 , this is Cavalier 41 5!

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:25.429
We've been in a collision
with a civilian vehicle.

00:29:25.597 --> 00:29:27.931
Carvey's dead
and Freeman's hurt real bad.

00:29:28.099 --> 00:29:30.350
We need medevac immediately.

00:29:30.518 --> 00:29:32.561
He's got kids, Base 1 , he's got kids!

00:29:34.189 --> 00:29:36.023
That sucked.

00:29:36.191 --> 00:29:39.151
MAN: Roger, Cavalier 415.
-Come on, Jensen. You're better than that.

00:29:39.319 --> 00:29:42.029
-Scrambling a chopper. Hang in there.
-He's got kids.

00:29:42.197 --> 00:29:43.614
So contrived.

00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:45.741
I used to be good at that. Right, Roque?

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:47.326
-Shut up.
-Thanks, man.

00:29:48.328 --> 00:29:49.661
Robert De Niro who?

00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:52.331
-Jensen, shut up.
-You shut up, Roque.

00:29:52.499 --> 00:29:55.709
You're dead. I'm spinal injury.
Spinal injury can talk. Dead can't.

00:29:55.877 --> 00:29:57.920
Stop talking or l'll break your neck really.

00:29:58.087 --> 00:30:00.464
You really gotta start getting
into character.

00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:03.342
I'm serious, man. Dead guy, no talking.

00:30:05.678 --> 00:30:06.762
All right.

00:30:08.765 --> 00:30:13.268
PlLOT: Base 1 , this is Medvac Delta.
We have visual on Cavalier 41 5.

00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:16.021
Here we go.

00:30:25.365 --> 00:30:27.366
Buddy, we'll get you patched up
in no time.

00:30:27.534 --> 00:30:29.827
Oh, my God. Hi.

00:30:29.994 --> 00:30:31.370
What's your name?

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.081
CLAY:
Fire when ready, Cougar.

00:30:35.416 --> 00:30:36.834
Ow.

00:30:38.753 --> 00:30:41.880
-Oh, shit.
PlLOT: What the hell's going on?

00:30:49.222 --> 00:30:50.597
Woo-hoo.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.936
You've just been chopper-jacked, fellas.

00:31:04.612 --> 00:31:05.863
Where's my wild goose?

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.990
POOCH:
The GPS?

00:31:09.117 --> 00:31:10.534
Got it!

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:17.207
Have you ever seen an EMT
look like this?

00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:19.418
Really, bro? "Hi, what's your name?

00:31:19.586 --> 00:31:21.295
I have no legs,
but I wanna take you on a date"?

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.674
Yo, J.

00:31:26.301 --> 00:31:29.678
What do you think is up with all this
"Don't call me colonel" stuff?

00:31:29.846 --> 00:31:31.763
JENSEN:
It's classic loss of identity.

00:31:31.931 --> 00:31:34.600
Clay defined himself by his place
in military structure...

00:31:34.767 --> 00:31:36.768
...his way of measuring the good he did.

00:31:36.936 --> 00:31:40.898
Without it, he's just another loser
like the rest of us.

00:31:41.441 --> 00:31:43.859
You know cats can make
a thousand different sounds...

00:31:44.027 --> 00:31:45.527
...and dogs can only make ten?

00:31:46.946 --> 00:31:51.491
Cats. Not to be trusted.

00:31:51.659 --> 00:31:53.827
Okay, do me a favor
and never repeat that.

00:31:53.995 --> 00:31:55.662
Okay? We're all set.

00:31:58.666 --> 00:32:02.419
Ready to take a giant step for...

00:32:02.587 --> 00:32:04.922
...guys who like to steal stuff, I guess.

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:07.674
CLAY: Hit it.
-Showtime.

00:32:12.013 --> 00:32:13.347
Beautiful.

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:16.642
-Now, that's a rocket!
-Let them chase that.

00:32:16.851 --> 00:32:17.851
That is a rocket!

00:32:18.019 --> 00:32:19.311
-Wow, shit!
-Did you see that?

00:32:19.479 --> 00:32:21.021
MAN:
Medevac Delta, this is Base 1 .

00:32:21.189 --> 00:32:23.941
-Oh, my God.
-l'm the black MacGyver. BlaGyver.

00:32:24.108 --> 00:32:26.485
MAN: What's your situation? Over.
-Time to move.

00:32:59.227 --> 00:33:00.394
Hi.

00:33:06.901 --> 00:33:08.735
Where you from originally?

00:33:10.738 --> 00:33:12.072
The wilds of Northern Africa.

00:33:12.532 --> 00:33:14.866
Wow, so that must've been...

00:33:20.248 --> 00:33:22.541
...sandy.

00:33:26.921 --> 00:33:28.588
Do you have any hobbies?

00:33:29.632 --> 00:33:32.467
When I was little, l collected human ears.

00:33:34.095 --> 00:33:35.470
Good times.

00:33:37.932 --> 00:33:39.057
But it's--

00:33:50.903 --> 00:33:53.071
No, no, no, my friend, listen.

00:33:53.239 --> 00:33:56.116
A gas turbine generator
running a force-fed rectifier unit.

00:33:56.284 --> 00:33:59.369
Hook it up to the fuel tank
and...we're in the game.

00:33:59.537 --> 00:34:03.206
There are few things in life that
liberal application of duct tape can't solve.

00:34:03.666 --> 00:34:05.917
Are small arms gonna be a problem?

00:34:06.294 --> 00:34:08.462
It's taken care of. Thanks.

00:34:09.464 --> 00:34:12.466
Which brings me to my question, Aisha.

00:34:12.633 --> 00:34:14.801
-What do you want with Max?
-Roque.

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:16.970
No. She did her part.

00:34:17.305 --> 00:34:18.805
All right?

00:34:18.973 --> 00:34:21.975
We got home.
I mean, we could walk right now.

00:34:22.143 --> 00:34:24.311
-You can, but we made a deal.
-Fuck deals, okay?

00:34:24.479 --> 00:34:25.687
You made a deal with Clay.

00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:29.566
I want answers.

00:34:35.656 --> 00:34:39.076
Max is trying
to buy next-generation weapons.

00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:40.494
I don't know the endgame.

00:34:41.245 --> 00:34:44.915
What l do know is when Max takes
an interest in something, people die...

00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:46.500
...and world maps get redrawn.

00:34:46.667 --> 00:34:50.003
Bullshit. Do you really think
you could take him on, little girl?

00:34:50.171 --> 00:34:52.964
No, big boy. You are.

00:34:53.132 --> 00:34:55.675
I think I'm just gonna kill her
right now, Clay.

00:34:55.843 --> 00:34:58.345
-No, you're not.
-Yes, I am.

00:34:58.513 --> 00:35:02.265
I'm right here. You wanna shoot
your bankroll, go right ahead.

00:35:04.352 --> 00:35:05.519
CLAY:
Roque.

00:35:06.854 --> 00:35:08.146
Roque.

00:35:12.235 --> 00:35:15.070
Okay, you stay with us,
but if anything smells like a trap...

00:35:15.238 --> 00:35:19.241
...l get to put a bullet in your skull.
Does that sound fair?

00:35:19.408 --> 00:35:20.992
That sounds fun.

00:35:22.578 --> 00:35:23.995
Sounds like my parents.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:28.708
-l knew you weren't gonna shoot her.
-Not today.

00:35:35.424 --> 00:35:37.384
GUARD:
Southwest perimeter secure.

00:35:43.391 --> 00:35:44.391
Load and go.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:48.186
CLAY:
That's the prize. That's where Max is.

00:35:48.354 --> 00:35:52.399
ROQUE: Yeah, l sure hope he doesn't see us
in this bright yellow banana Pinto.

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:56.069
Trying to say that you're embarrassed
to be seen in an American classic?

00:35:56.237 --> 00:35:57.863
This is an American classic?

00:35:59.574 --> 00:36:00.907
ROQUE:
All right.

00:36:01.242 --> 00:36:02.576
Here we go.

00:36:02.743 --> 00:36:04.703
CLAY:
Let's see what you got.

00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:11.459
Good shot.

00:36:12.503 --> 00:36:14.171
ROQUE:
Clay, where are the seatbelts, bro?

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:17.966
We don't need seatbelts.
The G-forces will hold you in your seat.

00:36:20.219 --> 00:36:21.303
CLAY:
Jensen, are we wired?

00:36:22.054 --> 00:36:23.096
JENSEN:
Max is westbound.

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:28.101
And these hot dogs are delicious.

00:36:34.275 --> 00:36:37.110
ROQUE: This is not a sweet car, dog.
CLAY: This is a classic.

00:36:37.278 --> 00:36:40.071
ROQUE:
Yeah, this is a classic piece of shit.

00:37:16.859 --> 00:37:19.152
MAN 1 :
Come on, back up! Move that car!

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.987
Lead vehicle hit. Give me the exits.

00:37:21.155 --> 00:37:23.323
MAN 2:
Northbound and southbound are blocked.

00:37:23.491 --> 00:37:24.574
We're trying to clear now.

00:37:24.742 --> 00:37:26.243
Dismount.

00:37:27.828 --> 00:37:30.288
Form a defensive perimeter
around the package.

00:37:41.676 --> 00:37:43.468
CLAY:
This will wake them up.

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:47.514
Masks on!

00:38:06.909 --> 00:38:08.201
Oh, shit.

00:38:10.538 --> 00:38:11.705
Pooch?

00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:16.001
Open fire! Shoot it down now!

00:38:17.336 --> 00:38:18.670
All right, here we go.

00:38:33.978 --> 00:38:35.812
Goddamn.

00:38:37.523 --> 00:38:39.691
We are under attack. We need backup.

00:38:46.032 --> 00:38:48.241
All right, easy. Go to your right now.

00:38:49.618 --> 00:38:51.995
All right, ease down, ease down,
to your left.

00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:54.080
No, no, your other left. Easy, easy.

00:38:54.248 --> 00:38:55.665
-Can you let me do this?
-Sure.

00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:56.916
Can you let me do this?

00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:04.382
That's right, bitches. l got a crossbow.

00:39:06.552 --> 00:39:08.428
JENSEN:
Backdoor is sealed. Take him up.

00:39:22.443 --> 00:39:23.902
Get out of my way!

00:39:34.747 --> 00:39:36.164
Whoa!

00:39:38.626 --> 00:39:42.754
-You said small arms weren't a problem.
-Does that look like small arms to you, huh?

00:39:42.922 --> 00:39:46.132
-He has a cannon down there.
-Doughnut. Doughnut, doughnut, doughnut!

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.848
WADE:
Shit!

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:57.227
Sure you've done this before?

00:39:57.395 --> 00:40:02.065
Okay, right now, not the time.
Not the time right now.

00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:03.900
Pooch, what's your status?

00:40:04.068 --> 00:40:08.446
Completely irritated and possibly crashing,
but fish is on the hook.

00:40:08.656 --> 00:40:10.323
We got Max.

00:40:10.491 --> 00:40:11.533
Barely.

00:40:27.842 --> 00:40:32.178
Fellas. You're not gonna believe this shit.
Wade was there.

00:40:32.346 --> 00:40:33.638
Wade Travis, 7th Group?

00:40:33.848 --> 00:40:34.889
He made me, Clay.

00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:36.641
No question.

00:40:36.809 --> 00:40:39.060
-Who's he?
POOCH: Ran counter-guerrilla ops with him.

00:40:39.228 --> 00:40:41.771
Just say he's a bad man.

00:40:42.648 --> 00:40:44.190
I thought you guys were bad men.

00:40:44.358 --> 00:40:47.318
-He's worse.
-All right, but right now, we need to deal...

00:40:47.486 --> 00:40:50.530
...with the heavily armed evil genius
inside this truck.

00:40:50.698 --> 00:40:51.948
Come on.

00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:53.616
You ready?

00:40:57.455 --> 00:40:59.038
Open the valve.

00:41:01.709 --> 00:41:03.376
CLAY:
All right, let's unlock this thing.

00:41:09.425 --> 00:41:10.842
GUARD:
Hit the ground!

00:41:11.594 --> 00:41:13.761
Hit the ground or l'll blow your head off!

00:41:14.054 --> 00:41:15.555
Yeah, l don't think so.

00:41:15.723 --> 00:41:17.307
GUARD:
First and final warning.

00:41:17.641 --> 00:41:20.477
Gasoline, muzzle flash, think about it.

00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:25.482
Put them down.

00:41:32.698 --> 00:41:33.948
Coug.

00:41:35.201 --> 00:41:37.494
-Where is he?
GUARD: Who?

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.496
Max.

00:41:40.915 --> 00:41:41.915
Who the hell is Max?

00:41:45.085 --> 00:41:46.711
-l can explain.
-Shut up.

00:41:48.422 --> 00:41:49.422
Jensen, open it.

00:41:58.891 --> 00:41:59.933
It's a hard drive...

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:04.604
...from Goliath, the multinational
manufacturer of everything.

00:42:06.273 --> 00:42:07.482
I'm completely locked out.

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:11.277
Without a decryption key,
you're looking at a really cool paperweight.

00:42:19.787 --> 00:42:21.788
Shoot her. Burn everything.

00:42:22.248 --> 00:42:25.041
-Don't you wanna find out what's on it?
-No.

00:42:25.668 --> 00:42:27.085
I can't find Max.

00:42:28.712 --> 00:42:30.255
Nobody can.

00:42:30.422 --> 00:42:34.717
But l knew that he was moving something
that was very valuable to him.

00:42:34.885 --> 00:42:36.135
Clay!

00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:40.807
Whatever it is, we can use it against him.
It's leverage!

00:42:40.975 --> 00:42:43.977
JENSEN: The drive is proprietary technology
built by Goliath.

00:42:44.144 --> 00:42:46.688
The algorithm's probably
on the mainframe.

00:42:51.151 --> 00:42:54.070
-Come on. We're not considering that.
-Wait, wait, wait.

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:57.574
Oh, no, come on, man.
We're not the good guys anymore.

00:42:57.741 --> 00:42:59.576
CLAY:
Twenty-five kids.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:03.079
Twenty-five innocent lives lost
because of this guy. Remember?

00:43:03.247 --> 00:43:04.289
ROQUE: l do.
-You were there.

00:43:04.456 --> 00:43:05.832
Yeah, l was there.

00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:08.751
-Max is gonna pay.
-ls this a guilt trip?

00:43:08.919 --> 00:43:11.212
No, I don't want him to pay.
I want my life back.

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:15.300
Okay? My life back.
Enough of this revenge bullshit.

00:43:15.968 --> 00:43:19.637
-l'm killing her right now.
-You don't like the way l'm running things...

00:43:20.014 --> 00:43:22.015
...you can find the door.

00:43:22.182 --> 00:43:23.600
And go where, Clay?

00:43:23.767 --> 00:43:25.393
Huh? Go where?

00:43:26.061 --> 00:43:29.272
We're fugitives. Because of you.

00:43:29.773 --> 00:43:31.691
What the hell are
you gonna do next, huh?

00:43:31.859 --> 00:43:34.777
Put us in a box, because you got beat
by a guy on a radio?

00:43:34.945 --> 00:43:36.863
JENSEN: Hey, whoa.
POOCH: Okay, all right, all right.

00:43:37.031 --> 00:43:39.365
-Cool out, cool out.
ROQUE: You shouldn't have done that.

00:43:39.533 --> 00:43:41.659
CLAY: l did do it.
-You shouldn't have done that.

00:43:41.869 --> 00:43:43.369
I'm gonna cut your head off, man.

00:43:44.204 --> 00:43:45.538
Bring it!

00:43:45.748 --> 00:43:47.540
-Hey, get off!
CLAY: Roque.

00:43:47.708 --> 00:43:50.793
POOCH:
They know we're alive, Roque.

00:43:51.795 --> 00:43:54.881
Only thing we have to use against them
right now is that drive.

00:43:56.467 --> 00:43:59.427
She framed us. Are you guys blind?
She framed us!

00:44:00.554 --> 00:44:02.805
We hit Goliath Worldwide headquarters
in two days.

00:44:03.015 --> 00:44:06.476
You want your life back?
You're gonna have to steal it.

00:44:06.685 --> 00:44:08.895
You're wrong, you know that, right?

00:44:09.063 --> 00:44:10.938
-Again because of a woman!
-Cut her loose.

00:44:11.899 --> 00:44:13.358
POOCH:
Cut her loose.

00:44:13.859 --> 00:44:15.193
Cut her loose, Roque.

00:44:15.569 --> 00:44:17.070
You cut her loose, bro.

00:44:22.951 --> 00:44:24.661
This is on you.

00:44:43.555 --> 00:44:45.264
MAN:
We're all set, sir.

00:44:45.432 --> 00:44:46.766
MAX:
Commence.

00:44:46.934 --> 00:44:49.268
-Code.
-Pulsar.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:52.980
What's pulsar?

00:44:54.358 --> 00:44:56.359
What do you know about
deep space tachyons?

00:44:57.444 --> 00:44:58.611
Nothing.

00:45:00.406 --> 00:45:02.657
-Base-particle string theory?
-Nothing.

00:45:02.866 --> 00:45:04.575
Singularity events?

00:45:04.743 --> 00:45:05.952
WADE:
Not a ton.

00:45:07.788 --> 00:45:09.956
I think we should move on, then.

00:45:17.673 --> 00:45:22.301
I'm gonna give you 45 seconds to explain
what happened to my drive.

00:45:27.808 --> 00:45:30.101
And who am l looking at here, Wade?

00:45:30.978 --> 00:45:32.228
Clay and his unit.

00:45:32.438 --> 00:45:36.315
Clay and his unit?
That sounds like a porno, Wade.

00:45:36.483 --> 00:45:38.317
You had them killed four months ago.

00:45:38.485 --> 00:45:40.570
I've done a lot in four months, Wade.

00:45:40.738 --> 00:45:41.988
I'm a very busy man.

00:45:42.156 --> 00:45:43.781
The Bolivia situation?

00:45:43.991 --> 00:45:44.991
Fadhil.

00:45:45.159 --> 00:45:46.826
The Max intel Fadhil gathered--

00:45:47.161 --> 00:45:49.787
Was incinerated along
with everything else in the blast.

00:45:49.997 --> 00:45:51.247
These guys survived.

00:45:51.832 --> 00:45:53.166
And they have my drive.

00:45:53.625 --> 00:45:55.001
Yeah.

00:45:56.003 --> 00:45:58.880
Okay, so five dead men
hijacked you, Wade.

00:45:59.047 --> 00:46:01.340
Did you happen to find out
who's behind them?

00:46:01.633 --> 00:46:05.344
-Not the ClA, NSA, special ops.
-Yeah, I'm aware it's not us.

00:46:06.513 --> 00:46:10.391
Seems like the only thing we do know is
who they're coming after.

00:46:14.897 --> 00:46:18.941
Get me an 1 8-man fire team in 1 2 hours.

00:46:20.319 --> 00:46:22.570
-What's the plan?
-What's the plan?

00:46:22.738 --> 00:46:25.990
The plan is get me
an 1 8-man fire team in 1 2 hours.

00:46:26.158 --> 00:46:28.701
-Okay.
-Are we clear on the plan?

00:46:28.869 --> 00:46:31.078
Or we could do it a third time.

00:46:31.789 --> 00:46:33.372
-Clear.
-Good.

00:46:33.999 --> 00:46:36.709
Oh, Wade, you know what l was thinking?
I forgot earlier.

00:46:36.877 --> 00:46:40.129
Get me an 1 8-man fire team in 1 2 hours.

00:46:40.756 --> 00:46:42.215
Are we clear?

00:47:07.533 --> 00:47:09.033
Do you want some?

00:47:47.281 --> 00:47:48.906
AlSHA:
Pooch has a wife.

00:47:50.284 --> 00:47:52.159
Jensen has a niece.

00:47:53.579 --> 00:47:57.915
When all this is over and they go home
to their families, what are you gonna do?

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:02.253
I'll think of something.

00:48:03.714 --> 00:48:07.174
They'll never let you be a soldier again.
You know that, right?

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:15.391
-You have no one, do you?
-Do you?

00:48:18.979 --> 00:48:20.646
I got Roque.

00:48:25.819 --> 00:48:27.194
You know...

00:48:27.821 --> 00:48:30.364
...if you two really fought...

00:48:31.283 --> 00:48:32.450
...he would kill you.

00:48:35.787 --> 00:48:37.163
Why's that?

00:48:37.789 --> 00:48:39.373
Because of the others.

00:48:41.126 --> 00:48:42.752
You care what happens to them.

00:48:44.087 --> 00:48:45.546
And you think that's a weakness?

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:47.840
I know it is.

00:48:48.967 --> 00:48:50.343
It's the law of the jungle.

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:52.637
Well, thankfully, we're not in the jungle.

00:48:52.804 --> 00:48:54.347
Yes, we are.

00:49:30.759 --> 00:49:31.801
Good morning.

00:49:34.763 --> 00:49:35.805
Oh, wow.

00:49:35.973 --> 00:49:39.183
That's just peachy.

00:49:39.351 --> 00:49:40.476
POOCH:
All right, look.

00:49:40.644 --> 00:49:43.896
We're not going anywhere
until you two squash this bullshit.

00:49:44.064 --> 00:49:46.065
-We are on a schedule here. Let's go.
-Yeah.

00:49:46.233 --> 00:49:48.859
Oh, we're on a schedule. Okay.

00:49:50.529 --> 00:49:51.654
What are you doing?

00:49:58.161 --> 00:49:59.286
Roque...

00:50:01.748 --> 00:50:03.833
...l'm sorry l hit you in the face.

00:50:05.585 --> 00:50:08.087
That was good. That was good. Roque?

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.214
Roque?

00:50:10.424 --> 00:50:13.676
Clay, l'm sorry l threatened
to cut your head off.

00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:16.470
POOCH:
Very good. Wow.

00:50:17.264 --> 00:50:19.098
Don't you two feel so much better?

00:50:19.766 --> 00:50:20.766
-No.
-No.

00:50:20.934 --> 00:50:23.352
I don't give a shit, because l do.

00:50:23.562 --> 00:50:27.273
Now, l say we go watch Jensen
get himself killed. Yup?

00:50:38.452 --> 00:50:41.454
A singer in a smoky room

00:50:42.622 --> 00:50:46.042
Smell of wine and cheap perfume

00:50:46.418 --> 00:50:49.295
For a smile they can share the night

00:50:49.463 --> 00:50:54.050
lt goes on and on
And on and on

00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:57.762
Strangers waiting

00:50:59.222 --> 00:51:01.557
Up and down the boulevard

00:51:10.025 --> 00:51:11.776
WOMAN:
Goliath Worldwide Enterprises.

00:51:11.943 --> 00:51:12.985
Mr. Anderson, please.

00:51:13.153 --> 00:51:16.781
Mr. Frank Anderson, Human Resources.
One moment, please.

00:51:22.329 --> 00:51:23.370
Wow.

00:51:25.916 --> 00:51:29.126
Liking the angle of the dangle? Heh.

00:51:29.294 --> 00:51:31.754
WOMAN 1 : Mm.
WOMAN 2: Nice.

00:51:34.841 --> 00:51:35.841
This is Anderson.

00:51:36.009 --> 00:51:38.761
JENSEN: Mr. Anderson, this is Richard Hertz
from lnternal Security.

00:51:38.929 --> 00:51:41.222
I'm wondering if you'd make your way
to the lobby.

00:51:41.389 --> 00:51:42.515
ANDERSON:
What is this about?

00:51:42.682 --> 00:51:45.434
Well, it's a matter of somewhat
sensitive nature...

00:51:45.602 --> 00:51:49.188
...involving an individual exposing himself
to women in the elevator.

00:51:49.356 --> 00:51:51.649
Nasty business, really.
Best discussed in person.

00:51:51.858 --> 00:51:53.317
All right. l'm on my way.

00:51:53.485 --> 00:51:55.194
I'll see you there.

00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:04.203
Thank you.

00:52:10.377 --> 00:52:11.710
JENSEN:
Hi.

00:52:11.878 --> 00:52:15.589
I'm Skippy from Tech Support, here
to install the firewall on Anderson's system.

00:52:15.757 --> 00:52:19.426
You just missed him. But if you want,
you can come back in, like, an hour?

00:52:19.594 --> 00:52:22.138
I could be out in minutes.
He doesn't have to be there.

00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:24.390
-You can't go in.
-Upstairs is riding me.

00:52:24.558 --> 00:52:28.144
-But you can't-- Sir--
-Thank you, l appreciate it. I like your dress.

00:52:30.355 --> 00:52:31.689
Dress?

00:52:32.732 --> 00:52:33.816
Too much.

00:52:36.444 --> 00:52:37.862
Algorithm's on the mainframe.

00:52:43.118 --> 00:52:44.994
Downloading it now.

00:52:48.582 --> 00:52:51.584
GUARD: Skippy?
-Hey! Shit.

00:52:51.751 --> 00:52:53.752
-Really?
-Oh, ho, wow.

00:52:55.463 --> 00:52:57.673
Look, l know this probably doesn't look--

00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:06.599
Clay, l need an exit!

00:53:06.766 --> 00:53:10.144
CLAY: Circle around the
north side of the building. You'll have cover.

00:53:21.114 --> 00:53:22.615
Freeze!

00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:24.742
Wow, this got serious.

00:53:33.376 --> 00:53:35.085
I'm warning you.

00:53:35.295 --> 00:53:40.299
I am a lethal killing machine.
It was a secret government experiment.

00:53:40.467 --> 00:53:45.262
They did stuff to me. Spooky stuff.

00:53:46.973 --> 00:53:48.641
Anal stuff.

00:53:49.017 --> 00:53:51.977
Turned me into a dangerous telekinetic.

00:53:52.938 --> 00:53:55.648
As the ancient Tibetan philosophy states:

00:53:56.149 --> 00:54:00.069
"Don't start none, won't be none."

00:54:10.705 --> 00:54:12.539
Telekinetic your way out of this.

00:54:13.416 --> 00:54:14.500
-Pow.
-Ah!

00:54:16.294 --> 00:54:17.836
-Poof.
-Argh!

00:54:22.592 --> 00:54:26.804
Face down, or I'll make your heart
stop beating with my mind.

00:54:32.435 --> 00:54:33.477
Thank you, Cougar.

00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:45.114
JENSEN: Who's got the hard drive?
-Yeah.

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:49.159
And uploading the algorithm.

00:54:51.204 --> 00:54:52.538
And....

00:54:53.415 --> 00:54:57.042
Holy shit. Girlfriend was right. Ha, ha, ha.

00:54:57.294 --> 00:54:59.295
-lt's a courier drive.
-A what?

00:54:59.462 --> 00:55:02.381
Twenty-first-century bagman.
Russian mob banks pioneered them.

00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:04.883
-Like an electronic bearer bond.
POOCH: Okay, all right.

00:55:05.051 --> 00:55:07.636
Say that again,
but a lot slower and dumber, please.

00:55:08.305 --> 00:55:10.556
Okay. Pretend you are super evil.

00:55:10.724 --> 00:55:13.726
And you want to move
a ton of your ill-gotten blood money...

00:55:13.893 --> 00:55:17.021
...but you can't,
because it can be tracked.

00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:19.106
So you load your cash onto
this bad boy...

00:55:19.274 --> 00:55:21.900
...and you can physically move it
anywhere you wanna go.

00:55:22.068 --> 00:55:24.361
And we have Max's courier drive, right?

00:55:24.738 --> 00:55:27.573
We have Max's $400 million.

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:31.910
POOCH: All right, Clay, before you go
do something noble like smashing it...

00:55:32.078 --> 00:55:34.038
...l say we go on Amazon
and get a jet.

00:55:34.205 --> 00:55:35.497
It doesn't work that way.

00:55:35.665 --> 00:55:39.209
Unfortunately courier drives can only load
and unload on their home systems.

00:55:39.419 --> 00:55:44.089
Although if we were gonna buy stuff,
I'd say a canary-yellow stretch Hummer.

00:55:44.257 --> 00:55:46.467
No, no. We're gonna trade it back to him.

00:55:46.676 --> 00:55:48.761
He's gonna get his money
and clear our names.

00:55:48.928 --> 00:55:50.304
-No, we made a deal.
-Yes.

00:55:50.513 --> 00:55:51.764
Aisha.

00:55:52.932 --> 00:55:54.933
He's gotta kill us now. You know that.

00:55:56.311 --> 00:55:57.436
Yeah, l know that.

00:55:57.604 --> 00:56:00.606
This has a record of every lP address
it's been jacked into.

00:56:00.774 --> 00:56:03.609
And there's one address
that comes up a lot.

00:56:03.777 --> 00:56:05.861
Obviously someplace
this keeps going back to.

00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:07.112
Max's base of ops.

00:56:10.033 --> 00:56:11.909
Port of Los Angeles.

00:56:14.788 --> 00:56:17.790
Thing probably has files on
every black-book op he's ever pulled.

00:56:18.833 --> 00:56:19.917
Including Bolivia.

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:22.419
JENSEN: We could hit him there,
we could clean it out...

00:56:22.587 --> 00:56:24.963
...expose the world to what he's done.

00:56:25.131 --> 00:56:26.590
Clear our names in the process.

00:56:27.342 --> 00:56:29.468
All right, it's a good plan.

00:56:31.096 --> 00:56:32.179
And we still kill him.

00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:36.433
Absolutely.

00:56:40.647 --> 00:56:44.024
We appreciate you meeting us
at a single-story facility.

00:56:44.192 --> 00:56:45.567
No problem.

00:56:45.735 --> 00:56:48.028
I view that entire incident
as your standard...

00:56:48.196 --> 00:56:50.656
..."getting to know each other"
business orientation.

00:56:50.824 --> 00:56:51.949
I agree.

00:56:52.117 --> 00:56:53.909
But now that we do know each other...

00:56:54.077 --> 00:56:58.497
...know that if you ever come near me with
that Yankee Doodle, tough-guy bullshit...

00:56:58.665 --> 00:57:01.208
...you will be fed to my dogs.

00:57:03.086 --> 00:57:05.754
As you know, we had a hiccup
on our end with the money.

00:57:05.922 --> 00:57:08.757
One billion dollars. This is the new price.

00:57:08.925 --> 00:57:10.843
-One billion?
-Cash.

00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:12.678
Cash is gonna be difficult.

00:57:12.846 --> 00:57:17.808
Difficult? Mr. Wade, life the way
you people want to live it is difficult.

00:57:17.976 --> 00:57:21.687
You want less difficult?
Move to my country. Study Hinduism.

00:57:21.855 --> 00:57:25.899
Meditate. Cultivate serenity.
Way less difficult.

00:57:26.067 --> 00:57:29.069
But you want to buy bombs.

00:57:30.321 --> 00:57:33.449
I'm afraid that's a more difficult
way of life.

00:57:34.451 --> 00:57:35.909
Mr. Wade.

00:58:05.899 --> 00:58:06.899
Hello.

00:58:07.817 --> 00:58:10.569
He wants one billion, in cash.

00:58:10.737 --> 00:58:12.154
MAX:
That's a lot of paper routes.

00:58:13.406 --> 00:58:14.823
Stay wet.

00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:18.327
Did you get me my 1  8-man firing team
I asked for?

00:58:18.495 --> 00:58:20.078
-Yup.
-Okay.

00:58:20.538 --> 00:58:23.123
Change of plans. Kill them.

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:24.833
Kill my 1  8 guys?

00:58:25.001 --> 00:58:27.419
Or fire them. Whichever is easiest.

00:58:27.587 --> 00:58:29.755
Honestly, firing them.

00:58:29.923 --> 00:58:32.883
Okay. Did you give them intel
on Clay's people?

00:58:33.259 --> 00:58:36.136
-Well, yeah.
-And we're back to killing them.

00:58:37.263 --> 00:58:40.766
Fine, l'll kill them.
What are we doing instead?

00:58:40.934 --> 00:58:43.143
What's the matter? You related to them?

00:58:43.353 --> 00:58:44.770
Actually one of them, yeah.

00:58:45.271 --> 00:58:46.939
Really? By blood?

00:58:47.106 --> 00:58:50.526
A brother-in-law. l said l'd kill him.
What are we doing?

00:58:51.027 --> 00:58:55.322
It's not what we're gonna do.
It's what Clay's gonna do for us.

00:58:55.532 --> 00:58:59.284
-And that is?
-Get us our billion, baby.

00:59:10.797 --> 00:59:12.047
What are we up against?

00:59:17.971 --> 00:59:18.971
Chryon.

00:59:19.138 --> 00:59:20.722
Oh, shit.

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.432
Who's Chryon?

00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:25.477
Chryon Security Solutions.
Ex-Special Forces.

00:59:25.645 --> 00:59:28.981
Basically a bunch of guys like Cougar
without the warm and cuddly side.

00:59:31.609 --> 00:59:34.278
We start recon at 0600.

00:59:34.612 --> 00:59:36.989
Anyone not here for it...

00:59:37.865 --> 00:59:39.199
...l'll understand.

00:59:58.177 --> 01:00:00.512
I was just going over the plan.

01:00:01.472 --> 01:00:03.515
You wanna go over the plan?

01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:06.351
Let's go over the plan.

01:00:14.736 --> 01:00:16.570
JENSEN:
Ah, shit.

01:00:16.738 --> 01:00:18.071
You okay?

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:21.033
Petunias are playing the Marigolds
on Sunday.

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:23.452
So?

01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:25.954
These are the Marigolds.

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:27.664
Whoa.

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:30.167
-Those are some hard-looking  8-year-olds.
-l know.

01:00:30.335 --> 01:00:32.711
Look at these inmates. Heh, heh.

01:00:33.379 --> 01:00:34.588
What are you doing?

01:00:36.591 --> 01:00:41.386
I was just trying to connect
Fadhil's drug operation with Max's cash.

01:00:41.554 --> 01:00:44.389
There's about 4 million missing.
I'm trying to track it down.

01:00:45.558 --> 01:00:49.269
-What are you doing, Pooch?
-Jensen hacked a satellite for me earlier.

01:00:49.437 --> 01:00:51.063
What you need a satellite for?

01:00:55.693 --> 01:00:57.027
Wait a second, is that today?

01:00:57.570 --> 01:00:59.571
POOCH:
Yeah.

01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:01.740
Probably knows
if it's a boy or a girl now.

01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:04.076
-Congratulations, man.
POOCH: Congratulations.

01:01:04.243 --> 01:01:05.410
Thank you, man.

01:01:05.578 --> 01:01:07.913
Say that now, but you know Jolene.

01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:10.290
She finds out I'm alive,
she's gonna kill me.

01:01:14.879 --> 01:01:17.214
I can't let her have that baby
without me.

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:23.095
What? What?

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.931
Pooch, we all know
we're gonna die in there.

01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:30.894
And we can do that without you.

01:01:31.562 --> 01:01:32.813
No, you can't.

Fadhil's 4 million didn't disappear.
It just went into a private account.

Whose account?

Paint a terrorist camp
so we could bomb it.

01:02:08.474 --> 01:02:12.227
Turns out we were just executing
some Max vendetta.

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:14.771
So you knew nothing about Fadhil?

01:02:14.939 --> 01:02:16.565
A target's a target.

01:02:18.151 --> 01:02:21.862
Never would have known the difference
if we hadn't seen those kids and gone in.

01:02:24.115 --> 01:02:25.949
You went in?

01:02:26.492 --> 01:02:28.243
Well, yeah. We had to.

It was 25 innocent kids in there, Aisha.

She's Fadhil's daughter!
Fadhil's daughter.

01:02:54.187 --> 01:02:55.729
Oh, shit.

She's got a gun and it's pointed at my dick.
Clay, it's pointed at my dick.

01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:03.653
Rather it was pointed at your face?

01:03:03.821 --> 01:03:05.614
I know it makes no sense, but yes.

Hi, how are you?
How've you been? Namaste?

01:04:43.462 --> 01:04:47.799
I recently attended the funeral of my

I can't complain.

Yes.

I gotta go home, to Springfield.

His niece is in New Hampshire.

01:19:26.803 --> 01:19:29.472
ROQUE: There you go, there you go!
Get it in there, let's go!

01:19:31.641 --> 01:19:34.351
I got Roque. Rest of you get Wade.
Cougar, run point cover.

01:19:34.519 --> 01:19:36.687
Legless Pooch and I are on it.
Come on, buddy.

01:19:40.942 --> 01:19:44.236
Call me Legless Pooch again,
you're gonna be Headless Jensen.

01:19:45.197 --> 01:19:48.282
I think it's a cool name.
Makes you sound like a pirate.

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:49.533
Your mama's a pirate.

01:19:58.168 --> 01:19:59.585
Go!

01:20:02.047 --> 01:20:03.380
Cover me!

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:19.230
-Get us in the air.
-We don't have room for lift.

01:20:19.397 --> 01:20:22.149
Hey, do as you're told!
Go down there and turn around!

01:20:27.614 --> 01:20:29.156
-Shit!
-Damn it.

01:20:42.087 --> 01:20:45.214
You know, I always wondered
how this was gonna play out, Clay.

01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:47.842
I told you already. You die very badly.

01:20:48.927 --> 01:20:50.135
Oh, yeah?

01:20:50.887 --> 01:20:51.929
All right.

01:21:07.904 --> 01:21:09.780
Oh, my God.

01:21:13.577 --> 01:21:15.578
Jensen, run! Run!

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:31.302
-Now l'm definitely gonna cut your head off.
-Go for it.

01:21:36.975 --> 01:21:39.393
ROQUE:
Son of a bitch!

01:21:54.451 --> 01:21:55.576
You lose!

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:12.760
We're clear to take off.
Get us out of here.

01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:13.969
Okay, all right.

01:22:14.137 --> 01:22:15.512
-Get us out of here.
-Okay!

01:22:16.514 --> 01:22:18.974
VlKRAM:
The ordnance is live.

01:22:19.559 --> 01:22:21.685
And this is the remote trigger.

01:22:23.813 --> 01:22:26.649
COMPUTERIZED VOlCE:
Detonation in ten, nine--

01:22:33.198 --> 01:22:35.282
That son of a bitch is stealing our cash!

01:23:01.935 --> 01:23:04.603
AlSHA:
Clay, Wade's on the move.

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:06.230
Clay!

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:08.983
You got Wade coming at you!

01:23:21.746 --> 01:23:22.997
-Run him over.
-What?

01:23:23.164 --> 01:23:24.206
Run him over!

01:23:43.601 --> 01:23:44.935
Take him.

01:24:16.301 --> 01:24:17.926
Outstanding.

01:24:27.604 --> 01:24:28.979
JENSEN:
Clay, we got a situation here.

01:24:29.147 --> 01:24:32.858
l'm looking at a giant, vibrating
Easter egg from hell and no Max.

01:24:33.026 --> 01:24:34.151
I think I see him.

01:24:34.319 --> 01:24:37.446
Initiate backup plan C.

01:24:39.324 --> 01:24:41.158
The one where you rescue me.

01:24:53.129 --> 01:24:54.421
Shit.

01:25:01.304 --> 01:25:03.180
ETA? l'm at rendezvous.

01:25:06.684 --> 01:25:09.686
Hello?

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:14.149
What's the matter? Crappy reception?

01:25:24.536 --> 01:25:26.829
-That was my ride.
-Bummer.

01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:29.498
-Clay, is it?
-Colonel.

01:25:29.666 --> 01:25:31.291
So you know what this is, then?

01:25:31.501 --> 01:25:33.794
-Remote pressure trigger.
-Very good.

01:25:34.212 --> 01:25:37.548
I release the button for ten seconds
and everything goes boom.

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:41.635
So since you can't shoot me--

01:25:44.097 --> 01:25:45.556
Goddamn it!

01:25:45.723 --> 01:25:47.182
You wanna try that again?

01:25:48.893 --> 01:25:50.269
That hurt.

01:25:52.939 --> 01:25:55.023
Having fun? Enjoying yourself?

01:25:55.191 --> 01:25:56.900
Give me the trigger, l let you live.

01:25:57.068 --> 01:25:59.444
You know the worst thing about
being the good guy?

01:25:59.654 --> 01:26:00.696
What's that?

01:26:03.116 --> 01:26:04.741
Having to make decisions like this.

01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:42.571
Hey! Ha, ha, ha. Look what Pooch found!

01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:44.114
Look what l found.

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:46.408
This should do it.

01:26:52.081 --> 01:26:53.123
Disarmed.

01:26:55.919 --> 01:26:57.127
Hello?

01:27:01.299 --> 01:27:02.758
It's Max.

01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:09.348
Hi, Max.

01:27:09.515 --> 01:27:11.892
MAX:
Colonel. Nice catch.

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:16.104
We could've shared the dream together.
Now you're back to where you started.

01:27:16.272 --> 01:27:18.482
Yeah, well, l wouldn't go that far.

01:27:18.650 --> 01:27:19.942
Why's that?

01:27:20.109 --> 01:27:22.611
Well, now l know what you look like.

01:27:22.987 --> 01:27:25.405
Be seeing you soon, Max.

01:27:36.584 --> 01:27:38.627
It's a nice watch, homes.

01:27:47.053 --> 01:27:48.595
Come with us.

01:27:50.598 --> 01:27:54.393
When this is over and he's dead...

01:27:55.687 --> 01:27:57.562
...you and l are gonna finish that dance.

01:27:59.023 --> 01:28:00.941
Fair enough.

01:28:03.736 --> 01:28:06.321
Yo, let's go home.

01:28:07.365 --> 01:28:08.699
She is volatile.

01:28:18.918 --> 01:28:20.627
Poppa, Poppa, we are clear.

01:28:21.421 --> 01:28:23.046
Setting perimeter.

01:28:24.007 --> 01:28:25.465
You're five by.

01:28:28.761 --> 01:28:31.138
I'm a little nervous
about this one, colonel.

01:28:33.016 --> 01:28:35.934
CLAY: Whatever happens,
you get to that package.

01:28:43.443 --> 01:28:45.944
-Mission is live.
-Acknowledged.

01:28:48.531 --> 01:28:49.990
I'm in.

01:29:00.668 --> 01:29:04.588
Okay. The Pooch can do this.

01:29:07.342 --> 01:29:09.885
The Pooch can do this.

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:18.935
Hey.

01:29:19.103 --> 01:29:20.604
DOCTOR:
Sir, you can't come in here.

01:29:20.772 --> 01:29:22.064
It's okay.

01:29:24.067 --> 01:29:25.233
I'm the father.

01:29:25.735 --> 01:29:27.235
Where the hell have you been?

01:29:28.905 --> 01:29:30.280
Traffic.

01:29:32.784 --> 01:29:33.950
Traffic?

01:29:42.418 --> 01:29:46.171
POOCH:
lt's a boy. lt's a boy, Clay.

01:29:46.339 --> 01:29:48.799
-And he looks just like me.
CLAY: Congrats.

01:29:51.719 --> 01:29:53.095
Cheers.

01:30:18.538 --> 01:30:21.415
AlSHA: We're taking a big chance here.
CLAY: They're getting slaughtered.

01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:33.343
Come on, ref! Watch number nine!
She's throwing elbows!

01:30:33.511 --> 01:30:34.845
-Shh.
-Shh.

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:38.014
Sorry. l'm sorry.

01:30:39.851 --> 01:30:42.227
Hi. My niece, number 21 .

01:30:42.854 --> 01:30:44.146
She's the star of the team.

01:30:46.858 --> 01:30:48.275
-Diaper change.
-What?

01:30:50.528 --> 01:30:53.947
-Colonel, you wanna jump on this for me?
-l'd rather jump on a live grenade.

01:30:54.157 --> 01:30:56.533
I'm invested.
I have 1 00 dollars on this game.

01:30:56.701 --> 01:30:59.161
Who'd you find to bet
on a girls' soccer game with?

01:30:59.328 --> 01:31:01.037
Yeah.

01:31:01.205 --> 01:31:02.539
You bet against the Petunias?

01:31:02.707 --> 01:31:04.124
Well, he gave me points.

01:31:04.333 --> 01:31:05.876
Big mistake.

01:31:06.294 --> 01:31:07.961
Let's go, girls. Let's go, girls!

01:31:11.382 --> 01:31:12.716
Oh, no.

01:31:16.387 --> 01:31:18.763
Hey, hey, hey! You okay?
Are you all right?

01:31:18.973 --> 01:31:23.435
-What is that? That is a foul! Are you blind?
-Get off the field, sir! Are you blind?

01:31:23.644 --> 01:31:25.312
Hey, boss, boss.

01:31:25.938 --> 01:31:28.899
-Get off the field!
-You're not gonna blow your whistle?

01:31:29.066 --> 01:31:30.233
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:32.235
-Better--
-Yeah, we should.

01:31:32.403 --> 01:31:34.738
-A girl kicked to the ground is not a foul?
-Get off!

01:31:34.906 --> 01:31:38.200
I wanna know who you work for!
How high up does this go?

01:31:38.409 --> 01:31:39.576
Get off the field!

01:31:39.744 --> 01:31:41.912
This is worse than the NBA!

01:31:42.079 --> 01:31:43.205
Okay, come on.

01:31:43.664 --> 01:31:45.415
Come on. Loser!

01:31:45.583 --> 01:31:47.417
You don't deserve to wear those stripes!
