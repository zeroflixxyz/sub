Matt, I'm sure this
comes as no surprise,

01:45:04.006 --> 01:45:08.635
but parts of this report are
going to have to be altered
for national security.

01:45:09.971 --> 01:45:11.388
Which parts, sir?

01:45:11.472 --> 01:45:12.889
Well. . .

01:45:13.474 --> 01:45:15.517
David Barlow can't
be held responsible

01:45:15.601 --> 01:45:17.477
for what happened
to the safe house.

01:45:18.312 --> 01:45:20.897
We just don't
need the scandal.

01:45:20.982 --> 01:45:23.483
But, sir,
you and I both know that,
that is just not the truth.

01:45:23.567 --> 01:45:26.152
People don't want
the truth anymore, Matt.

01:45:26.237 --> 01:45:29.114
It's too messy.
Keeps them up nights.

01:45:33.369 --> 01:45:35.662
I'll tell you what I am
willing to do, though.

01:45:36.497 --> 01:45:39.582
I think the Agency
has grossly
underestimated you,

01:45:39.667 --> 01:45:43.795
and I'm recommending you
for a senior case officer
position.

01:45:43.879 --> 01:45:45.380
Provided you still want it.

01:45:46.298 --> 01:45:48.925
That's a generous
offer, sir.

01:45:50.052 --> 01:45:53.763
There's just
one thing you need
to clarify for me.

01:45:53.848 --> 01:45:55.140
Of course.

01:45:56.225 --> 01:45:59.227
Frost may have been
carrying some vital intel.

01:45:59.311 --> 01:46:00.645
A file.

01:46:01.230 --> 01:46:04.107
I'm not seeing that
anywhere in this report.

01:46:11.532 --> 01:46:13.324
What was
on the file, sir?

01:46:13.409 --> 01:46:16.119
Something that,
quite frankly,
could be very damaging

01:46:16.203 --> 01:46:18.538
to the Agency
and to our allies.

01:46:21.709 --> 01:46:25.837
I don't see why Frost
would even mention
something like that to me.

01:46:31.093 --> 01:46:33.511
No, I suppose he wouldn't,
would he?

01:46:37.892 --> 01:46:41.144
You realize, though,
that if that file did leak,

01:46:42.688 --> 01:46:44.814
what would happen
to the person responsible?

01:46:44.899 --> 01:46:46.900
That person would
be arrested, sir.

01:46:46.984 --> 01:46:48.818
He'd be risking
everything.

01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:53.656
He'd have enemies
in every intelligence
agency in the world.

01:46:55.284 --> 01:46:58.828
In the eyes of the CIA,
he'd be just like
Tobin Frost.

01:47:02.666 --> 01:47:05.585
Frost didn't say anything
about a file, sir.

01:47:10.841 --> 01:47:12.175
All right, son.

01:47:13.302 --> 01:47:14.886
Take a few days off.

01:47:14.970 --> 01:47:16.930
We'll get you
started next week.

01:47:18.766 --> 01:47:20.100
Thank you.

01:47:22.311 --> 01:47:25.271
And think about
our conversation,
would you?

01:47:25.523 --> 01:47:27.023
Will do.

01:47:27.108 --> 01:47:29.067
I'll take it
from here, sir.

01:47:54.677 --> 01:47:55.927
JOHN C. KING ON TV:
...and other media outlets

01:47:56.011 --> 01:47:58.847
received a controversial file
from an anonymous source.

01:47:59.056 --> 01:48:00.807
The international
intelligence community
is still reeling

01:48:00.891 --> 01:48:03.893
from the release of so many
highly classified documents

01:48:03.978 --> 01:48:07.480
and the revelations
of widespread corruption
and criminaI activity

01:48:07.565 --> 01:48:08.565
at the CIA,
the BND, and MI6.

01:48:08.649 --> 01:48:09.774
REPORTER 1 : ...is in
an uproar over the Iack

01:48:09.859 --> 01:48:11.734
of oversight given to
British Intelligence,

01:48:11.819 --> 01:48:14.154
demanding accountabiIity
of the rogue agents.

01:48:14.238 --> 01:48:15.989
Officials at Ml6
are fully cooperating.

01:48:16.073 --> 01:48:17.615
REPORTER 2:
Chancellor Merkel
insists that the BND

01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:19.534
has already identified
the corrupt agents

01:48:19.618 --> 01:48:21.411
and contained
the intelligence breach.

01:48:21.495 --> 01:48:23.079
She has ensured her
internationaI counterparts...

01:48:23.164 --> 01:48:25.165
REPORTER 3:
Indictments are now
expected within the week,

01:48:25.249 --> 01:48:27.792
and Congress has demanded
that Deputy Director
Harlan Whitford

01:48:27.877 --> 01:48:29.794
testify before
a Senate subcommittee

01:48:29.879 --> 01:48:31.546
in an effort to
determine how many peopIe

01:48:31.630 --> 01:48:33.423
at the CIA are
involved in this

01:48:33.507 --> 01:48:37.260
and just how far up
the corruption reaches.
