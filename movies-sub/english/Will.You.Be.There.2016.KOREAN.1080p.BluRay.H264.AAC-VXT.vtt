<i>2015, CAMBODIA</i>

00:02:23.834 --> 00:02:25.584
Dr. HAN! We gotta go!

00:02:25.667 --> 00:02:26.292
Bye!

00:02:26.376 --> 00:02:27.251
Bye!

00:02:44.334 --> 00:02:48.959
The next flight will be in
2 weeks 'cuz of the flood!

00:02:49.042 --> 00:02:50.084
Let's go.

00:02:53.501 --> 00:02:55.376
You're booked up back home.

00:02:57.501 --> 00:03:01.251
This is the last helicopter.

00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:07.292
Soo-hyun!

00:03:07.376 --> 00:03:08.542
Give me the bag!

00:03:08.626 --> 00:03:12.167
- Go home. I'll call you.
- What are you doing?

00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:14.334
Come back!

00:03:15.334 --> 00:03:16.709
Soo-hyun!

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:13.459
Thank you.

00:04:14.792 --> 00:04:16.001
Thank you.

00:04:20.751 --> 00:04:24.334
You see things better than most.

00:04:24.876 --> 00:04:31.542
I trust the things unseen
more than the seen.

00:04:33.834 --> 00:04:35.667
Is Lunan your granddaughter?

00:04:35.751 --> 00:04:41.376
I found her in the forest. Cleft
lip babies are thought cursed.

00:04:42.042 --> 00:04:44.251
You saved her life.

00:04:45.042 --> 00:04:50.751
You gave her a new life. I
thank you on behalf of Lunan.

00:04:51.042 --> 00:04:53.209
I just did what I should.

00:04:58.876 --> 00:05:04.501
Is there anything you
dearly wish for in life?

00:05:07.376 --> 00:05:08.959
Dearly wish for?

00:05:17.376 --> 00:05:21.251
There's someone I'm dying to see.

00:05:25.251 --> 00:05:27.751
You don't have much time.

00:05:39.417 --> 00:05:44.376
Life is what happens when you can't sleep.

00:05:58.751 --> 00:06:04.584
WILL YOU BE THERE?

00:06:05.667 --> 00:06:09.751
<i>Summer, Autumn, Winter, Mingky! Jump!</i>

00:06:16.417 --> 00:06:19.334
<i>The Moonwalk!</i>

<i>Mingky's spiral jump!</i>

00:06:30.251 --> 00:06:32.334
<i>Big applause, please!</i>

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:39.667
<i>Seoul Grand Park introduces...</i>

00:06:39.751 --> 00:06:43.001
<i>the only female trainer of Korea!</i>

00:06:43.584 --> 00:06:47.667
<i>CHOI Yeon-a!</i>

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.376
Had a nice nap?

00:07:00.876 --> 00:07:01.917
Enjoyed it?

00:07:02.001 --> 00:07:04.334
So fun. I lost track of time.

00:07:04.376 --> 00:07:05.584
I see.

00:07:07.334 --> 00:07:08.542
Yeon-a!

00:07:08.626 --> 00:07:12.959
I worked last night. I'll
watch it all next time.

00:07:13.042 --> 00:07:16.209
When? After I die?

00:07:16.292 --> 00:07:18.834
How can you say that?

00:07:20.292 --> 00:07:21.542
Yeon-a!

00:07:22.167 --> 00:07:23.584
Are you mad?

00:07:25.417 --> 00:07:26.542
CHOI Yeon-a!

00:07:27.751 --> 00:07:28.959
Yeon-a!

00:07:42.251 --> 00:07:43.251
Let me see.

00:07:43.334 --> 00:07:45.292
It's from before. I'm fine.

00:07:45.376 --> 00:07:47.376
When did you get hurt?

00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:49.084
I fell 'cuz of you!

00:07:49.126 --> 00:07:50.501
Why you!

00:07:50.542 --> 00:07:54.251
A doctor shouldn't hurt his hand.

00:07:54.959 --> 00:07:56.084
Yeon-a.

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:58.542
How long were we apart?

00:07:58.626 --> 00:07:59.626
1 minute.

00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:01.209
That long?

00:08:02.501 --> 00:08:03.792
Kiss me.

00:08:08.126 --> 00:08:10.167
Why here? 'Cuz of people?

00:08:10.251 --> 00:08:11.751
They're watching!

00:08:13.126 --> 00:08:16.334
- I missed you.
- Me too.

00:08:31.542 --> 00:08:32.667
Yeon-a!

00:08:33.876 --> 00:08:35.459
You're still here!

00:08:35.542 --> 00:08:37.417
What about your show?

00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:41.834
I forgot to say something important.

00:08:41.917 --> 00:08:42.959
What?

00:08:43.042 --> 00:08:46.667
<i>Passengers on the 5:30 train to Busan...</i>

00:08:47.084 --> 00:08:48.792
Let's talk on the way.

00:08:49.542 --> 00:08:51.167
Let's go.

00:08:51.251 --> 00:08:53.209
Just tell me?

00:08:54.709 --> 00:08:56.334
Is something wrong?

00:08:57.542 --> 00:09:02.376
Male dolphins cannot mate on its own.

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:07.001
So other males help him
to mate with the female.

00:09:07.084 --> 00:09:08.292
I think...

00:09:09.126 --> 00:09:12.042
You're like the male dolphin.

00:09:12.126 --> 00:09:13.834
What do you mean?

00:09:13.917 --> 00:09:16.292
You need help from others.

00:09:16.751 --> 00:09:19.167
<i>The train to Busan will soon depart.</i>

00:09:19.251 --> 00:09:21.001
I want to have your baby.

00:09:24.459 --> 00:09:26.417
I want your baby!

00:09:28.584 --> 00:09:31.667
- So assertive!
- I want a baby too!

00:09:31.751 --> 00:09:34.501
What are you saying? Have a baby here?

00:09:38.417 --> 00:09:40.292
I'll call when I arrive.

00:09:41.501 --> 00:09:43.417
Take good care.

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:45.042
Bye.

00:09:55.376 --> 00:09:58.667
- Looks like it didn't go well.
- It did.

00:09:58.751 --> 00:10:00.834
He wants to get married?

00:10:00.917 --> 00:10:02.167
Of course.

00:10:02.667 --> 00:10:03.876
Good!

00:10:11.792 --> 00:10:13.876
Dept. Of Marine Animals.

00:10:17.876 --> 00:10:19.709
Ecological report?

00:10:19.792 --> 00:10:21.334
I'll send it.

00:10:32.667 --> 00:10:34.209
What's this?

00:10:34.542 --> 00:10:38.626
Kids asked to have it
raised with its friends.

00:10:38.709 --> 00:10:40.792
Kids watch too many cartoons.

00:10:41.334 --> 00:10:42.334
So cute.

00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:44.626
This is no daycare.

00:10:45.584 --> 00:10:48.834
BUSAN STATION

00:11:38.876 --> 00:11:40.084
Are you okay?

00:11:40.584 --> 00:11:42.334
- Are you alright, sir?
- Yes.

00:11:44.751 --> 00:11:45.792
Where am I?

00:11:45.876 --> 00:11:49.417
Busan Station. Sure you're okay?

00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:50.917
Busan Station?

00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:00.376
Who are you?

00:12:02.417 --> 00:12:04.126
Just trying to help...

00:12:06.709 --> 00:12:08.251
What's your name?

00:12:10.876 --> 00:12:12.292
I'm HAN Soo-hyun.

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:16.667
But that's my name...

00:12:21.001 --> 00:12:22.459
Hey! Wait!

00:12:37.876 --> 00:12:38.917
Sir!

00:12:39.876 --> 00:12:41.501
Are you okay?

00:12:42.334 --> 00:12:44.834
Are you alright?

00:13:16.959 --> 00:13:17.917
Shit.

00:13:19.626 --> 00:13:20.959
Sir!

00:13:32.917 --> 00:13:34.709
Are you okay, sir?

00:13:36.167 --> 00:13:38.501
I need my handkerchief back.

00:13:40.751 --> 00:13:41.542
Sir?

00:13:41.626 --> 00:13:47.084
<i>Life is what happens when you can't sleep.</i>

00:13:48.126 --> 00:13:49.501
Sir!

00:13:52.626 --> 00:13:54.001
Sir?

00:13:55.209 --> 00:13:56.751
Are you in there?

00:14:04.001 --> 00:14:06.001
Are you alright, sir?

00:14:08.376 --> 00:14:09.376
Sir?

00:14:09.459 --> 00:14:10.584
Wait, please.

00:14:13.001 --> 00:14:14.709
Are you okay, sir?

00:14:14.792 --> 00:14:15.792
Yes.

00:14:16.126 --> 00:14:19.042
You were in there long. We were worried.

00:14:19.126 --> 00:14:20.584
I'm sorry.

00:14:23.917 --> 00:14:25.126
Excuse me.

00:15:04.834 --> 00:15:05.501
Hi.

00:15:05.584 --> 00:15:06.876
Busy?

00:15:06.959 --> 00:15:07.917
What's up?

00:15:08.001 --> 00:15:11.167
Just stopped by to see
if you got back okay.

00:15:11.251 --> 00:15:12.667
I had a good time.

00:15:13.042 --> 00:15:14.876
No trouble without me?

00:15:14.917 --> 00:15:18.292
You're one to talk. You caused havoc here!

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:21.334
We were busy covering your
surgeries and lectures!

00:15:21.417 --> 00:15:23.251
Always thankful.

00:15:23.542 --> 00:15:26.084
Then buy me dinner?

00:15:26.584 --> 00:15:27.501
Why not?

00:15:28.209 --> 00:15:29.501
What is it?

00:15:30.584 --> 00:15:32.126
Another surgery?

00:15:32.209 --> 00:15:33.792
How much time left?

00:15:34.417 --> 00:15:36.626
The tumor is over 5cm.

00:15:36.709 --> 00:15:39.126
Looks like it spread to the liver too.

00:15:39.917 --> 00:15:42.667
It's terminal lung cancer.
I give it 6 months.

00:15:43.084 --> 00:15:44.834
If it was a friend, what would you say?

00:15:44.917 --> 00:15:46.334
What's to say?

00:15:46.834 --> 00:15:50.584
I'd just help prepare him to die well.

00:15:50.667 --> 00:15:52.917
- I thought so.
- Who is it?

00:15:53.626 --> 00:15:54.917
Your bosom buddy?

00:15:55.001 --> 00:15:56.042
Tae-ho?

00:15:57.792 --> 00:16:00.334
He'll outlive us by 50 years.

00:16:00.417 --> 00:16:02.834
Oh no! He'll flip!

00:16:02.917 --> 00:16:05.667
Sorry! I gotta go.

00:16:05.917 --> 00:16:11.376
Running away again? No date, huh?

00:16:11.501 --> 00:16:13.126
I promise next time.

00:16:13.167 --> 00:16:14.501
Hold on!

00:16:15.042 --> 00:16:18.792
Could you get this analyzed?

00:16:18.876 --> 00:16:20.417
What is it?

00:16:23.667 --> 00:16:27.626
Crazy? What if the blind
gramps gave you something bad?

00:16:27.709 --> 00:16:31.209
What doctor takes strange pills like that?

00:16:31.292 --> 00:16:33.834
- It was so real.
- It's a hallucinogen.

00:16:34.334 --> 00:16:37.084
Like the pills people take
before bungee jumping.

00:16:38.334 --> 00:16:39.626
Whatever.

00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:45.042
All you do is work 24/7,
you must've gone crazy!

00:16:45.834 --> 00:16:47.251
How was it?

00:16:47.334 --> 00:16:48.959
Seeing yourself then?

00:16:50.667 --> 00:16:52.709
Good looking and young.

00:16:52.792 --> 00:16:54.209
Why you!

00:16:56.251 --> 00:17:03.667
This beach was hot back then
filled with pretty gals!

00:17:05.376 --> 00:17:10.709
They loved me! Wonder how they're living.

00:17:11.917 --> 00:17:14.417
JOO-Hong was hot.

00:17:14.667 --> 00:17:16.042
And Mi-sun.

00:17:17.251 --> 00:17:20.334
- But not Choon-Nam.
- You remember their names?

00:17:20.959 --> 00:17:26.334
If you meet him again,
tell him to get married.

00:17:26.417 --> 00:17:29.126
A smelly bachelor your whole life...

00:17:29.209 --> 00:17:30.584
If I go back...

00:17:36.251 --> 00:17:37.917
Think I can see her?

00:17:38.751 --> 00:17:40.042
Yeon-a.

00:17:41.501 --> 00:17:42.959
You serious?

00:17:43.792 --> 00:17:45.542
Get over it.

00:17:46.959 --> 00:17:49.042
It's been over 30 years.

00:17:50.459 --> 00:17:55.792
If you can meet her at
will, it'd be a miracle!

00:17:55.876 --> 00:17:57.251
Crazy fool.

00:17:57.334 --> 00:18:00.042
Lady! I'll get it!

00:18:00.126 --> 00:18:01.667
Oh yes!

00:18:06.417 --> 00:18:07.917
Crazy!

00:18:08.834 --> 00:18:09.959
Nice!

00:18:10.042 --> 00:18:10.959
Tae-ho!

00:18:11.042 --> 00:18:13.584
What's so important to call me out here?

00:18:13.667 --> 00:18:14.751
Catch.

00:18:16.126 --> 00:18:17.376
What's this?

00:18:17.459 --> 00:18:19.459
I'll move to Jeju to farm this.

00:18:20.376 --> 00:18:22.001
Why's a tangerine so big?

00:18:22.084 --> 00:18:23.126
Cool, huh?

00:18:23.209 --> 00:18:28.626
It's a Japanese Dekopon. A
mix of tangerine and orange.

00:18:28.959 --> 00:18:32.376
If I import and grow this,
I'll hit the jackpot.

00:18:32.459 --> 00:18:34.459
I even made a name for it.

00:18:34.542 --> 00:18:36.334
Orange-tangerine!

00:18:36.417 --> 00:18:39.084
Just stick to your job, pal.

00:18:41.584 --> 00:18:44.084
Did something happen in Seoul?

00:18:50.084 --> 00:18:52.292
Yeon-a wants to have a baby.

00:18:52.376 --> 00:18:53.709
All of a sudden?

00:18:55.292 --> 00:18:56.626
Lucky fool.

00:18:56.709 --> 00:18:58.167
Yeon-a is great!

00:18:58.251 --> 00:19:03.626
Rather than wait for you, she'll
throw you on the bed first?

00:19:06.167 --> 00:19:07.542
Lucky you.

00:19:07.626 --> 00:19:09.584
7 years is a long time to wait.

00:19:09.667 --> 00:19:10.626
Congratulations man!

00:19:10.709 --> 00:19:13.709
I don't plan on having any kids.

00:19:14.167 --> 00:19:16.042
I decided that long ago.

00:19:16.834 --> 00:19:20.292
If I was a girl, I'd marry you too.

00:19:21.584 --> 00:19:23.209
- You'll marry me?
- Sure.

00:19:23.292 --> 00:19:25.126
- Crazy!
- Why not!

00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:29.042
By the way...

00:19:29.667 --> 00:19:32.251
- I met someone strange last night.
- Pretty?

00:19:32.334 --> 00:19:33.876
- A man.
- Not interested.

00:19:34.584 --> 00:19:37.001
He seemed familiar for some reason.

00:19:37.084 --> 00:19:39.834
Probably a patient.

00:19:39.917 --> 00:19:42.917
Then I'd remember. His name's the same.

00:19:43.001 --> 00:19:45.042
Asked my name then said he's HAN Soo-hyun.

00:19:45.126 --> 00:19:47.209
He must be a psycho.

00:19:47.292 --> 00:19:50.167
His nose bled badly so I
followed him to the bathroom.

00:19:50.251 --> 00:19:52.417
- And?
- He disappeared.

00:19:52.834 --> 00:19:55.667
- Some magician?
- Really! He vanished!

00:19:55.792 --> 00:19:58.084
Must've seen it wrong.

00:19:58.167 --> 00:19:59.501
Must've, right?

00:20:00.334 --> 00:20:02.334
- I'm off.
- Soo-hyun!

00:20:02.417 --> 00:20:03.042
What?

00:20:03.126 --> 00:20:08.167
That gal with big boobs
keeps looking at me.

00:20:08.251 --> 00:20:12.084
She's sending me signals. See her winking?

00:20:12.167 --> 00:20:14.209
Then I should wink back!

00:20:14.292 --> 00:20:17.584
How do I look? Should I go to her?

00:20:17.667 --> 00:20:18.959
- Tae-ho?
- What?

00:20:19.042 --> 00:20:21.834
That Orangerine you talked about...

00:20:21.917 --> 00:20:23.959
Do it. It'll work.

00:20:24.542 --> 00:20:26.959
Orangerine?

00:20:27.376 --> 00:20:29.292
You're a genius!

00:20:53.209 --> 00:20:54.667
<i>SOO-A</i>

00:20:57.792 --> 00:20:59.876
<i>- My girl!
- Hi, Dad!</i>

00:20:59.959 --> 00:21:01.959
It's been ages. Where are you?

00:21:02.042 --> 00:21:04.251
<i>The library. Is something wrong?</i>

00:21:04.251 --> 00:21:08.209
Of course not. Just wanted to talk to you.

00:21:08.251 --> 00:21:09.417
<i>About what?</i>

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:10.709
Why you!

00:21:11.334 --> 00:21:13.501
Are you eating right?

00:21:13.792 --> 00:21:15.626
<i>Of course! And you?</i>

00:21:15.917 --> 00:21:18.917
Daddy eats well.

00:21:19.001 --> 00:21:21.501
<i>Don't skip meals 'cuz I'm not there!</i>

00:21:22.917 --> 00:21:25.292
I hear a man's voice.

00:21:25.376 --> 00:21:27.584
Where the hell are you?

00:21:27.876 --> 00:21:31.709
<i>What's with you? Hang up
if you're going to nag.</i>

00:21:35.626 --> 00:21:37.334
<i>Caught a cold?</i>

00:21:38.001 --> 00:21:40.001
Something's in my throat.

00:21:40.167 --> 00:21:44.084
<i>I'll be home soon after my exams.</i>

00:21:44.167 --> 00:21:45.626
<i>Let's talk in person.</i>

00:21:45.709 --> 00:21:47.251
See you then.

00:22:22.167 --> 00:22:23.584
Nine left.

00:22:27.667 --> 00:22:29.376
I'll die soon anyway.

00:22:56.626 --> 00:22:58.667
- Geeze!
- Oh my!

00:22:59.917 --> 00:23:01.751
- Why'd you come?
- Here.

00:23:01.834 --> 00:23:02.626
What's this?

00:23:02.709 --> 00:23:05.209
Let's start building one by one.

00:23:06.126 --> 00:23:08.042
You came down here for this?

00:23:08.126 --> 00:23:10.084
Cute, huh? Our family!

00:23:10.167 --> 00:23:11.709
I've never raised a dog.

00:23:11.792 --> 00:23:13.126
It's okay.

00:23:13.376 --> 00:23:14.876
I gotta catch my train.

00:23:14.959 --> 00:23:16.042
You're leaving?

00:23:16.126 --> 00:23:18.876
I don't want to, but I got a morning show.

00:23:18.959 --> 00:23:20.209
Don't go.

00:23:20.292 --> 00:23:21.876
You two get along.

00:23:21.959 --> 00:23:22.626
Take care.

00:23:22.709 --> 00:23:24.417
I've never raised a puppy!

00:23:24.501 --> 00:23:26.084
You're really leaving?

00:23:26.167 --> 00:23:28.334
- Busan Station, please.
- I can't raise a dog.

00:23:28.334 --> 00:23:30.792
Animals and people are the same.

00:23:30.876 --> 00:23:33.501
Watch carefully and you'll
know what they want.

00:23:33.584 --> 00:23:34.626
Don't go.

00:23:35.042 --> 00:23:38.376
<i>POTATOES</i>

00:23:38.709 --> 00:23:42.459
What now? This is nuts.

00:23:44.334 --> 00:23:47.792
Your name's Potato from now on.

00:23:48.042 --> 00:23:49.209
Eat this.

00:24:06.209 --> 00:24:07.542
Let's sleep.

00:24:38.542 --> 00:24:41.292
I made it? I'm here?

00:24:41.376 --> 00:24:43.584
Who's there?

00:24:46.876 --> 00:24:48.792
There's nothing to take so...

00:24:57.167 --> 00:24:59.167
May 30th, 1985?

00:25:00.334 --> 00:25:01.542
Exactly 30 years.

00:25:01.626 --> 00:25:05.334
You're the man from Busan Station, right?

00:25:05.417 --> 00:25:08.459
Clean up! You moved in long ago.

00:25:08.542 --> 00:25:11.126
How'd you come to my house?

00:25:12.167 --> 00:25:13.209
Cuz it's my house too.

00:25:13.292 --> 00:25:18.584
Don't touch anything! Get the hell out now!

00:25:18.667 --> 00:25:21.251
You still don't know who I am?

00:25:21.334 --> 00:25:23.126
How would I know?

00:25:25.167 --> 00:25:26.459
Are you a patient?

00:25:26.542 --> 00:25:29.667
Not a patient but a pediatric surgeon.

00:25:31.209 --> 00:25:34.001
I'm a pediatric surgery resident.

00:25:36.001 --> 00:25:39.542
Must be a psychiatric patient.
What's your name?

00:25:39.626 --> 00:25:42.251
I told you it's HAN Soo-hyun.

00:25:42.751 --> 00:25:44.376
This is insane!

00:25:44.792 --> 00:25:49.459
Give me your ID. I'll call to get you help.

00:25:53.751 --> 00:25:54.626
HAN SOO-HYUN

00:25:54.709 --> 00:25:56.376
Haven't seen this TV in so long!

00:25:58.334 --> 00:25:59.501
Sir?

00:26:00.251 --> 00:26:01.334
Here.

00:26:02.626 --> 00:26:05.459
What kind of joke is this?

00:26:06.042 --> 00:26:09.376
Come on! Issued in year 2008?

00:26:09.417 --> 00:26:11.667
Potato? It's you!

00:26:12.709 --> 00:26:16.584
Long time no see Potato!

00:26:23.167 --> 00:26:24.584
How do you know its name?

00:26:26.084 --> 00:26:27.709
Cuz I named him.

00:26:30.459 --> 00:26:35.042
I know it's hard to believe.
To be honest, I still don't.

00:26:35.917 --> 00:26:39.001
But you're me 30 years ago
and I'm you 30 years later.

00:26:40.417 --> 00:26:42.417
That makes no sense.

00:26:42.501 --> 00:26:45.042
Makes sense I vanished from that bathroom?

00:26:55.917 --> 00:26:57.334
What the hell!

00:26:57.584 --> 00:26:59.459
- Want a taste from the future?
- No!

00:26:59.542 --> 00:27:01.542
If you don't leave, I'll call the cops.

00:27:01.584 --> 00:27:04.376
The cops? You mean Tae-ho?

00:27:07.584 --> 00:27:11.042
You can't believe this. I understand.

00:27:11.876 --> 00:27:14.292
We're all believers in science.

00:27:15.292 --> 00:27:20.709
But as you get older, the belief fades.

00:27:20.792 --> 00:27:22.001
Please just leave now.

00:27:22.084 --> 00:27:24.376
Will you believe if I say
a secret only we know?

00:27:24.459 --> 00:27:25.917
What secret?

00:27:27.376 --> 00:27:29.209
I don't have any secrets, sir.

00:27:29.292 --> 00:27:30.667
There's one.

00:27:31.542 --> 00:27:33.792
A secret we didn't tell anyone.

00:27:33.876 --> 00:27:35.042
What?

00:27:41.501 --> 00:27:43.459
We got beaten by Dad a lot.

00:27:44.001 --> 00:27:45.584
When he got drunk.

00:27:45.626 --> 00:27:48.584
Thought hiding it was helping Mom.

00:27:52.251 --> 00:27:55.834
You're scared to get hurt like that again.

00:27:56.542 --> 00:27:58.417
- Or to hurt others.
- Shut up!

00:27:59.167 --> 00:28:02.292
Why'd you move to Busan as
soon as Mom passed away?

00:28:02.376 --> 00:28:04.209
You wanted to forget.

00:28:05.001 --> 00:28:08.667
But think about who
helped you forget it all.

00:28:10.584 --> 00:28:11.917
Who are you?

00:28:14.709 --> 00:28:15.459
HAN Soo-hyun.

00:28:15.542 --> 00:28:17.626
What do you want from me?

00:28:20.209 --> 00:28:21.376
Nothing.

00:28:22.042 --> 00:28:24.001
Just want to see her once.

00:28:24.584 --> 00:28:25.959
Yeon-a.

00:28:26.042 --> 00:28:27.834
What the hell do you mean?

00:28:30.501 --> 00:28:31.834
Come back!

00:28:46.876 --> 00:28:49.292
Stay the hell away from Yeon-a!

00:28:50.084 --> 00:28:51.542
Or I'll kill you!

00:29:29.584 --> 00:29:31.501
Tae-ho! Open up!

00:29:31.584 --> 00:29:32.376
It's Soo-hyun!

00:29:32.459 --> 00:29:33.667
What is it?

00:29:34.251 --> 00:29:37.042
Hey, wait!

00:29:37.126 --> 00:29:38.792
Listen to me.

00:29:38.876 --> 00:29:40.959
Are you sick?

00:29:44.292 --> 00:29:45.542
It's totally unimaginable!

00:29:45.626 --> 00:29:48.001
Can't you see what I'm doing?

00:29:48.084 --> 00:29:49.417
Honey?

00:29:49.501 --> 00:29:50.917
Who is it?

00:29:51.001 --> 00:29:53.834
Don't mind him, baby! I'll send him off!

00:29:53.917 --> 00:29:55.792
- Go home.
- Busan Station!

00:29:57.209 --> 00:29:58.417
That man appeared again!

00:29:58.501 --> 00:30:00.001
The psycho? See ya.

00:30:00.084 --> 00:30:02.001
He barged into my house.

00:30:02.084 --> 00:30:04.001
He says he's me 30 years later!

00:30:04.084 --> 00:30:06.667
Okay, man. Let's talk tomorrow!

00:30:06.751 --> 00:30:08.376
He even knows...

00:30:10.084 --> 00:30:12.792
He knows that you're a cop.

00:30:13.751 --> 00:30:18.751
He said he'll meet Yeon-a, then vanished!

00:30:20.417 --> 00:30:21.917
12 o'clock...

00:30:25.251 --> 00:30:26.542
20 minutes.

00:30:28.084 --> 00:30:31.709
I stayed there 20 minutes.

00:30:43.709 --> 00:30:46.251
Fingerprint matching is not easy.

00:30:46.334 --> 00:30:49.667
TV shows make it look
way easier than it is.

00:30:49.751 --> 00:30:52.042
Then compare it with my fingerprints.

00:30:52.126 --> 00:30:53.459
You don't believe him do you?

00:30:53.542 --> 00:30:56.459
It says it was made in 2000.

00:30:56.542 --> 00:30:57.584
That's weird.

00:30:57.667 --> 00:31:00.209
No, that's the price! 2,000 Won!

00:31:00.292 --> 00:31:01.876
Wait!

00:31:02.209 --> 00:31:03.917
It's all filled out.

00:31:04.001 --> 00:31:05.459
Thank you.

00:31:08.417 --> 00:31:11.959
Worried about your girl, you
drag me out at this hour!

00:31:12.042 --> 00:31:15.084
But I was with Sun-young!

00:31:15.167 --> 00:31:17.251
Things were good.

00:31:19.501 --> 00:31:21.584
Did you call Yeon-a?

00:31:22.459 --> 00:31:23.417
Yeon-a...

00:31:23.501 --> 00:31:26.042
Can't use the phone here.

00:31:26.126 --> 00:31:29.334
Don't worry! It's just a crazy man's scam.

00:31:29.834 --> 00:31:31.876
I'll get you some water.

00:31:36.501 --> 00:31:37.376
<i>Dr. HAN?</i>

00:31:37.459 --> 00:31:38.167
Yes.

00:31:38.251 --> 00:31:42.292
<i>I got the results on the pill.
It's just a blend of plants.</i>

00:31:42.501 --> 00:31:43.334
Really?

00:31:43.417 --> 00:31:46.376
<i>It's made of mulberry and quince leaves.</i>

00:31:46.459 --> 00:31:49.084
<i>Looks like a placebo.</i>

00:31:49.459 --> 00:31:50.917
Of course.

00:31:51.001 --> 00:31:52.751
<i>But where'd you get it?</i>

00:31:53.417 --> 00:31:56.834
It's nothing. Thanks a lot.

00:32:07.459 --> 00:32:10.459
Call me if anything happens. Okay?

00:32:10.542 --> 00:32:13.001
<i>- Okay. I'll call you.
- Bye.</i>

00:32:15.376 --> 00:32:16.876
Got the results?

00:32:16.959 --> 00:32:19.084
Brace yourself and listen.

00:32:19.834 --> 00:32:23.126
This lighter only has your fingerprints.

00:32:23.209 --> 00:32:23.917
Serious?

00:32:24.209 --> 00:32:25.959
Of course I am!

00:32:27.417 --> 00:32:30.459
What's the chance of two
people's fingerprints...

00:32:30.542 --> 00:32:32.042
What am I saying?

00:32:32.126 --> 00:32:32.917
The chance?

00:32:33.001 --> 00:32:37.917
About as much as farting
1,500 times at once.

00:32:39.501 --> 00:32:41.001
Watch it!

00:32:41.084 --> 00:32:42.751
- I'm sorry.
- Hurry up!

00:32:42.834 --> 00:32:44.042
I'm going!

00:32:44.959 --> 00:32:46.584
Move it!

00:32:51.376 --> 00:32:52.751
Where was it?

00:32:52.834 --> 00:32:54.167
Here.

00:32:54.251 --> 00:32:55.459
Relax.

00:33:05.126 --> 00:33:07.834
Children need batteries
replaced more often.

00:33:07.917 --> 00:33:10.626
Beware of loose wires as they grow.

00:33:11.167 --> 00:33:14.709
Dr. HAN? Why is another doctor
doing the surgery tomorrow?

00:33:14.792 --> 00:33:18.959
He's a better expert in hearts.

00:33:19.042 --> 00:33:21.584
But why? You're her doctor.

00:33:21.667 --> 00:33:24.626
Can't you change the dates and do it?

00:33:25.292 --> 00:33:29.209
Don't worry. I'll ask him to...

00:33:29.292 --> 00:33:30.876
He'll do well.

00:33:44.876 --> 00:33:46.584
<i>PLEASE VISIT</i>

00:33:46.667 --> 00:33:48.626
Please visit?

00:33:53.209 --> 00:33:55.126
Pretty clever.

00:34:06.459 --> 00:34:07.501
Stop!

00:34:08.251 --> 00:34:09.917
Stop!

00:34:10.001 --> 00:34:10.792
Wait!

00:34:22.876 --> 00:34:25.167
Fool! Get moving!

00:34:34.626 --> 00:34:37.126
<i>PLEASE VISIT</i>

00:34:41.459 --> 00:34:43.251
Damn it.

00:34:48.876 --> 00:34:50.751
Forget it.

00:35:02.667 --> 00:35:03.792
Yes!

00:35:08.834 --> 00:35:10.334
Good...

00:35:17.334 --> 00:35:19.126
Hi, Soo-a!

00:35:19.209 --> 00:35:21.917
I'm sorry. I'm on my way.

00:35:23.459 --> 00:35:25.251
Sorry I'm late again.

00:35:25.459 --> 00:35:27.084
Busy as always.

00:35:27.626 --> 00:35:32.042
Speed up, Dad. Everyone's passing you.

00:35:32.126 --> 00:35:33.709
80km per hour zone.

00:35:33.792 --> 00:35:35.751
I'm going the right speed.

00:35:38.667 --> 00:35:41.417
Wanna take a trip? It's summer break.

00:35:42.042 --> 00:35:42.834
What about work?

00:35:42.917 --> 00:35:44.251
Doctors have vacations too.

00:35:44.292 --> 00:35:45.959
Could've fooled me.

00:35:46.001 --> 00:35:47.251
Why you...

00:35:47.334 --> 00:35:50.001
- Where should we go?
- Any ideas?

00:35:51.209 --> 00:35:53.001
Anywhere but the zoo.

00:35:54.209 --> 00:35:55.209
An aquarium.

00:35:55.292 --> 00:35:56.501
No way!

00:35:56.584 --> 00:35:59.334
I'm not going.

00:35:59.459 --> 00:36:01.042
An aquarium abroad?

00:36:02.501 --> 00:36:04.626
We've been to all of them.

00:36:09.251 --> 00:36:11.209
A dolphin, please. How much?

00:36:11.292 --> 00:36:12.584
800 won.

00:36:13.417 --> 00:36:14.251
Your change.

00:36:14.334 --> 00:36:17.584
- I'll take them all.
- Thank you!

00:36:24.334 --> 00:36:25.751
Yeon-a!

00:36:25.834 --> 00:36:27.084
CHOI Yeon-a!

00:36:29.584 --> 00:36:30.376
Wait there!

00:36:30.459 --> 00:36:32.459
Soo-hyun? What's that?

00:36:32.542 --> 00:36:33.917
Come on over.

00:36:37.834 --> 00:36:39.126
Soo-hyun!

00:36:40.709 --> 00:36:42.084
Are you okay?

00:36:42.584 --> 00:36:43.667
Wait!

00:36:47.626 --> 00:36:49.251
This wasn't it.

00:36:49.917 --> 00:36:51.084
What?

00:36:52.126 --> 00:36:53.792
Listen carefully.

00:37:00.542 --> 00:37:05.209
The Caspian tern gives
food to please its mate.

00:37:05.209 --> 00:37:10.626
Green frogs, white herons, and
zebra finches sing to please.

00:37:10.667 --> 00:37:12.376
You know I can't sing.

00:37:13.001 --> 00:37:17.126
♪ Nothing I can say... ♪

00:37:20.001 --> 00:37:22.876
I'm no better than those animals.

00:37:28.792 --> 00:37:30.751
So I brought these.

00:37:30.834 --> 00:37:32.292
I swear...

00:37:34.459 --> 00:37:37.251
I won't let go of your hand till I die.

00:37:42.459 --> 00:37:43.959
You know what?

00:37:48.376 --> 00:37:52.917
When elephants find their
mates, they go into the forest.

00:37:56.834 --> 00:37:58.792
- Hi, Mr. KIM!
- Hello.

00:37:58.876 --> 00:38:02.001
Lovely weather! Take care!

00:38:27.167 --> 00:38:28.376
Wait.

00:38:28.459 --> 00:38:30.251
Stop! It tickles!

00:38:31.209 --> 00:38:34.084
- Come on.
- It tickles.

00:38:37.126 --> 00:38:39.126
You're so beautiful.

00:38:42.251 --> 00:38:44.167
Trying to tame me?

00:38:55.042 --> 00:38:56.209
Wait.

00:38:57.084 --> 00:38:58.959
Many eyes are watching.

00:39:01.209 --> 00:39:03.251
They won't attack, right?

00:39:04.001 --> 00:39:05.459
Don't worry.

00:39:05.542 --> 00:39:08.167
You're with an expert trainer.

00:39:17.792 --> 00:39:19.209
Kid! Let's eat.

00:39:21.709 --> 00:39:23.042
Soo-a!

00:39:25.959 --> 00:39:27.042
What?

00:39:28.251 --> 00:39:30.042
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

00:39:32.334 --> 00:39:34.292
<i>MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS</i>

00:39:36.917 --> 00:39:38.917
- Like it?
- Yup.

00:39:39.167 --> 00:39:41.917
I came for your stew. That's all.

00:39:42.001 --> 00:39:43.042
Eat lots.

00:39:44.001 --> 00:39:45.334
You too.

00:39:46.459 --> 00:39:47.792
Hey, kid.

00:39:49.209 --> 00:39:51.542
How about studying in the States?

00:39:51.626 --> 00:39:54.417
No! I can't eat without Kimchi.

00:39:55.667 --> 00:39:59.334
There are great medical schools.

00:39:59.417 --> 00:40:00.459
And your mom's there.

00:40:00.542 --> 00:40:02.584
Why suddenly the States?

00:40:05.251 --> 00:40:07.209
- Soo-a...
- Something's fishy.

00:40:07.292 --> 00:40:09.626
Got a girlfriend now?

00:40:12.584 --> 00:40:14.876
Who? Is she pretty?

00:40:15.959 --> 00:40:17.834
Not a girlfriend...

00:40:18.667 --> 00:40:22.917
But I got something nasty.

00:40:26.542 --> 00:40:28.292
The stew's delicious.

00:40:29.876 --> 00:40:32.001
Maybe a bit salty.

00:40:35.042 --> 00:40:36.459
HAN Soo-a.

00:40:37.251 --> 00:40:39.042
Thanks for dinner.

00:40:57.292 --> 00:40:58.917
HAN Soo-a!

00:40:59.542 --> 00:41:01.584
Soo-a!

00:41:02.959 --> 00:41:04.626
HAN Soo-a!

00:41:07.084 --> 00:41:08.584
Soo-a!

00:41:15.959 --> 00:41:17.459
Soo-a!

00:41:26.542 --> 00:41:27.959
Meow!

00:41:31.876 --> 00:41:33.584
Meow!

00:41:39.084 --> 00:41:40.876
Aren't you cold?

00:41:46.834 --> 00:41:48.959
You're always late.

00:41:51.167 --> 00:41:52.542
I know.

00:41:53.334 --> 00:41:56.126
Uncle Tae-ho warns me all the time.

00:42:01.376 --> 00:42:03.167
But why...

00:42:37.876 --> 00:42:39.042
Here.

00:42:40.251 --> 00:42:42.709
Keep it. It's yours anyway.

00:42:43.459 --> 00:42:47.376
I'll keep this instead. It's mine anyway.

00:42:50.792 --> 00:42:52.501
You're me 30 years later?

00:42:52.584 --> 00:42:55.667
What's with this?

00:42:56.751 --> 00:42:58.792
Can't wear T-shirts now.

00:43:02.792 --> 00:43:04.959
How is this possible?

00:43:05.042 --> 00:43:07.959
Let's just call it a streak of luck.

00:43:08.042 --> 00:43:13.917
What's the world like in 2015?

00:43:14.001 --> 00:43:15.751
It's not much better.

00:43:18.501 --> 00:43:20.084
How's KIM Hyun-sik?

00:43:20.167 --> 00:43:21.501
The singer?

00:43:23.167 --> 00:43:25.584
He dies of liver cancer 5 years later.

00:43:26.042 --> 00:43:28.126
No cure for cancer even then?

00:43:29.459 --> 00:43:31.292
But technology is better.

00:43:31.376 --> 00:43:34.126
We can remove tumors without ventrotomy.

00:43:34.459 --> 00:43:37.376
Even without cutting the abdomen open?

00:43:38.334 --> 00:43:42.626
Still, there are new diseases and illness.

00:43:43.042 --> 00:43:45.917
I often think the simple past was better.

00:43:47.001 --> 00:43:51.126
Do I become a good doctor?

00:43:51.209 --> 00:43:52.917
You already are one.

00:43:53.209 --> 00:43:57.292
Insensitive to death and
knowing to keep a distance...

00:43:57.376 --> 00:43:58.667
I guess I become stronger.

00:43:58.709 --> 00:44:01.292
Your sensitivity made you a good doctor.

00:44:02.167 --> 00:44:04.459
<i>Hello everyone!</i>

00:44:05.917 --> 00:44:08.542
- Do I have kids?
- One daughter.

00:44:08.626 --> 00:44:11.751
<i>Welcome to the Dolphin Show!</i>

00:44:14.667 --> 00:44:17.584
Yeon-a must be a good mom.

00:44:20.376 --> 00:44:24.251
Why so curious? You'll
find out as you live.

00:44:24.334 --> 00:44:30.501
Korea's first female trainer, Ms.
CHOI Yeon-a!

00:44:33.501 --> 00:44:37.376
<i>Big applause, please!</i>

00:44:43.292 --> 00:44:45.001
<i>Hello!</i>

00:45:47.626 --> 00:45:49.626
<i>A big hand, please!</i>

00:45:51.751 --> 00:45:54.292
Are you sick somewhere?

00:45:55.459 --> 00:45:58.042
It's just time to go back.

00:45:58.542 --> 00:46:00.501
It's my last trip anyway.

00:46:03.584 --> 00:46:04.584
Wait!

00:46:06.542 --> 00:46:07.792
Hold on!

00:46:11.959 --> 00:46:14.251
Tell me about Yeon-a.

00:46:15.209 --> 00:46:16.751
Why'd you come?

00:46:16.834 --> 00:46:19.042
What's your real reason for coming?

00:46:19.126 --> 00:46:20.959
No reason. Just came to see Yeon-a.

00:46:21.001 --> 00:46:22.792
Isn't Yeon-a there in...

00:46:25.542 --> 00:46:27.209
Yeon-a isn't there?

00:46:27.292 --> 00:46:28.667
You'll find out.

00:46:29.709 --> 00:46:31.251
Answer me.

00:46:34.334 --> 00:46:36.417
Did something happen to her?

00:46:36.501 --> 00:46:37.459
You'll know later.

00:46:37.542 --> 00:46:39.459
Know what?

00:46:41.751 --> 00:46:43.709
Don't scare me.

00:46:43.792 --> 00:46:45.001
Tell me.

00:46:55.417 --> 00:46:57.167
Go to Yeon-a.

00:46:57.251 --> 00:46:59.084
Be good to her.

00:46:59.167 --> 00:47:00.876
Tell me everything.

00:47:01.834 --> 00:47:04.042
What happens to Yeon-a?

00:47:09.584 --> 00:47:11.376
Yeon-a will die soon.

00:47:14.876 --> 00:47:16.751
That's crazy.

00:47:18.501 --> 00:47:20.626
Why would Yeon-a die!

00:47:21.751 --> 00:47:23.709
She dies because of...

00:47:30.209 --> 00:47:34.126
Soo-hyun? Where are you?

00:47:35.667 --> 00:47:37.292
Soo-hyun!

00:47:44.459 --> 00:47:48.167
- What are you doing?
- Yeon-a...

00:48:18.626 --> 00:48:20.834
What am I doing?

00:48:32.167 --> 00:48:36.834
Why look at me while driving? Look ahead.

00:48:36.917 --> 00:48:39.792
Cuz you're pretty. Give me your hand.

00:48:41.959 --> 00:48:44.959
If I was any prettier, we'd be dead.

00:48:45.959 --> 00:48:48.459
- And...
- I'll keep the speed limit.

00:48:51.584 --> 00:48:53.876
How's the puppy I gave you?

00:48:53.959 --> 00:48:55.042
Potato?

00:48:55.126 --> 00:48:57.167
That's his name?

00:48:57.251 --> 00:49:00.459
It suits. Can't wait to see him.

00:49:04.209 --> 00:49:05.501
Sleep.

00:49:16.959 --> 00:49:19.626
Hold on. I gotta make a call.

00:49:24.376 --> 00:49:27.376
I brought you something
to apologize for before.

00:49:27.459 --> 00:49:30.167
Tada! Food!

00:49:30.251 --> 00:49:31.959
I made it myself.

00:49:32.959 --> 00:49:34.376
I said I'm on a diet.

00:49:34.459 --> 00:49:37.709
No, Sun-young! You're
as light as a feather.

00:49:37.792 --> 00:49:39.084
Open wide!

00:49:44.584 --> 00:49:45.876
I'm sorry.

00:49:48.126 --> 00:49:50.542
You want this instead?

00:49:50.626 --> 00:49:51.626
I'm good at this.

00:49:51.709 --> 00:49:53.626
- Do it right!
- Yes!

00:50:01.917 --> 00:50:03.251
- Mr. KANG Tae-ho?
- Yes.

00:50:03.334 --> 00:50:05.209
2 telegrams for you.

00:50:05.292 --> 00:50:06.834
At this hour?

00:50:06.917 --> 00:50:10.126
Said to read the top one first.

00:50:10.209 --> 00:50:13.167
Thank you very much.

00:50:13.792 --> 00:50:14.917
Goodnight.

00:50:17.834 --> 00:50:20.334
<i>Take the second telegram
and go to my house now.</i>

00:50:20.417 --> 00:50:22.376
What the hell?

00:50:26.417 --> 00:50:30.251
The criminal looks nasty...

00:50:34.292 --> 00:50:35.334
Look.

00:50:35.417 --> 00:50:37.834
If you leave now, we're through!

00:50:38.417 --> 00:50:39.501
I know...

00:50:41.959 --> 00:50:44.042
Die, you bastard!

00:50:44.126 --> 00:50:45.209
Bark! Bark!

00:50:47.417 --> 00:50:52.501
Your papa is a bastard.

00:50:53.792 --> 00:51:00.167
I could be hot and heavy
with Sun-young now.

00:51:00.917 --> 00:51:02.084
You know?

00:51:03.042 --> 00:51:06.126
You dissing me?

00:51:08.917 --> 00:51:12.292
I have a bad friend and you a bad papa.

00:51:15.501 --> 00:51:17.251
I did as you asked, pal.

00:51:19.251 --> 00:51:21.626
KIM Hyun-sik...

00:51:23.209 --> 00:51:26.834
The things I do for him...

00:51:26.876 --> 00:51:29.167
Ouch! It's working.

00:51:55.876 --> 00:51:56.959
Mom's album?

00:51:57.042 --> 00:51:58.042
<i>MOM'S ALBUM</i>

00:52:07.376 --> 00:52:10.959
<i>You get me worried and
just vanish like that?</i>

00:52:11.042 --> 00:52:12.917
<i>I'm in charge now.</i>

00:52:13.001 --> 00:52:16.751
<i>If you don't come, I'll ruin your life!</i>

00:52:16.834 --> 00:52:18.042
<i>Watch me!</i>

00:52:18.126 --> 00:52:19.834
<i>GEUM-GANG REST STOP</i>

00:52:19.917 --> 00:52:21.167
A pack of Sol, please.

00:52:21.251 --> 00:52:23.001
450 won, please.

00:52:24.876 --> 00:52:26.167
450 won.

00:52:29.209 --> 00:52:30.834
Wait.

00:52:30.917 --> 00:52:31.917
Here.

00:52:34.709 --> 00:52:37.292
Is this a joke?

00:52:37.751 --> 00:52:39.084
Sorry.

00:52:44.542 --> 00:52:48.334
I didn't come 'cuz of your
threats but to set things right.

00:52:48.417 --> 00:52:52.084
You're lying about Yeon-a dying, right?

00:52:52.167 --> 00:52:54.084
I wish, but it's true.

00:53:06.167 --> 00:53:08.084
Why would Yeon-a die?

00:53:08.792 --> 00:53:10.126
Cuz of you.

00:53:10.792 --> 00:53:11.542
What?

00:53:11.626 --> 00:53:14.917
You promised to hold on, but let go.

00:53:15.001 --> 00:53:17.001
You took her for granted.

00:53:17.084 --> 00:53:20.084
Don't talk like you know me. I'm different!

00:53:24.459 --> 00:53:26.667
There was an accident at the zoo.

00:53:33.292 --> 00:53:35.209
What accident? When?

00:53:35.292 --> 00:53:36.626
I can't say.

00:53:38.084 --> 00:53:41.542
But you know everything!

00:53:42.626 --> 00:53:44.334
You can save her!

00:53:44.417 --> 00:53:45.209
I can't.

00:53:45.292 --> 00:53:46.959
Then you'll let Yeon-a die?

00:53:50.626 --> 00:53:53.417
I never forgot for 30 years.

00:53:53.501 --> 00:53:56.751
If only I could go back and save Yeon-a...

00:53:58.126 --> 00:53:59.292
I thought a million times.

00:53:59.376 --> 00:54:00.626
Then do it.

00:54:01.751 --> 00:54:07.042
Save her. We can stop her from dying!

00:54:07.126 --> 00:54:08.251
Soo-a.

00:54:10.126 --> 00:54:11.542
My daughter.

00:54:11.626 --> 00:54:15.334
She was born 10 years after Yeon-a died.

00:54:15.417 --> 00:54:18.292
She was an unexpected gift.

00:54:20.001 --> 00:54:21.167
Forget it.

00:54:21.251 --> 00:54:23.959
What does she have to
do with saving Yeon-a?

00:54:24.042 --> 00:54:26.584
If Yeon-a lives, Soo-a can't be born.

00:54:26.667 --> 00:54:28.126
Look.

00:54:32.251 --> 00:54:34.542
I can save Yeon-a and
have a child with her.

00:54:34.626 --> 00:54:37.209
She's my daughter.

00:54:37.292 --> 00:54:42.917
I raised Soo-a for 20 years. I
wouldn't trade her for anyone.

00:54:43.001 --> 00:54:45.667
And I can't live in a world without Yeon-a.

00:54:45.751 --> 00:54:48.001
The past cannot be changed.

00:54:48.084 --> 00:54:50.251
This moment can't be changed either.

00:54:52.542 --> 00:54:57.542
It may be the past to you,
but it's the future for me.

00:54:57.626 --> 00:55:00.376
And I decide my future!

00:55:01.626 --> 00:55:03.084
It's no use.

00:55:11.126 --> 00:55:13.001
What if I don't have Soo-a?

00:55:16.084 --> 00:55:19.584
If we don't save Yeon-a, I
won't be with anyone else.

00:55:19.667 --> 00:55:22.001
Then Soo-a can't be born.

00:55:32.292 --> 00:55:37.376
Can you give up everything to save Yeon-a?

00:55:40.501 --> 00:55:43.209
Even my life, if I have to!

00:55:45.417 --> 00:55:47.292
Even if it's Yeon-a?

00:55:50.334 --> 00:55:52.459
Mommy's here!

00:55:54.334 --> 00:55:56.209
Potato!

00:55:59.084 --> 00:56:00.709
How've you been?

00:56:02.376 --> 00:56:04.459
You've grown so much.

00:56:08.001 --> 00:56:09.709
<i>Leave Yeon-a.</i>

00:56:10.292 --> 00:56:13.209
<i>You mean break up with her?</i>

00:56:13.292 --> 00:56:15.334
That's my first condition.

00:56:15.417 --> 00:56:16.834
But Yeon-a is my everything.

00:56:16.917 --> 00:56:19.417
It's the only way to save Yeon-a and Soo-a.

00:56:20.959 --> 00:56:22.542
Can you do it?

00:56:28.584 --> 00:56:30.334
Forget it then.

00:56:35.667 --> 00:56:36.542
Stop!

00:56:36.626 --> 00:56:37.876
Your hands will save lives!

00:56:37.959 --> 00:56:41.292
Who cares when I can't even save Yeon-a!

00:56:44.584 --> 00:56:45.751
You okay?

00:56:57.751 --> 00:56:59.084
Yeon-a...

00:57:00.959 --> 00:57:03.417
Please save her.

00:57:04.126 --> 00:57:08.376
Second condition is that
you can't tell anyone.

00:57:08.459 --> 00:57:11.376
Tae-ho already knows. He can be trusted.

00:57:11.459 --> 00:57:12.667
I know.

00:57:13.501 --> 00:57:17.542
But it could change Tae-ho's life.

00:57:17.626 --> 00:57:21.501
We don't know what can change the future.

00:57:21.584 --> 00:57:23.751
It has to be just the two of us.

00:57:23.834 --> 00:57:27.209
No, just the one man who knows.

00:57:28.667 --> 00:57:29.751
Remember...

00:57:29.834 --> 00:57:32.584
You can't meet Yeon-a again.

00:57:34.626 --> 00:57:40.042
She'll be alive somewhere, but
we must live like she's gone.

00:57:46.709 --> 00:57:49.459
HAN Soo-hyun.

00:57:51.376 --> 00:57:53.584
- Soo-hyun?
- Hmm?

00:57:53.667 --> 00:57:55.376
How's Soo-a?

00:57:58.001 --> 00:58:00.584
- Soo-a?
- Yup.

00:58:00.667 --> 00:58:02.376
For our baby's name.

00:58:02.459 --> 00:58:04.876
Soo' from Soo-hyun and 'a' from Yeon-a.

00:58:04.959 --> 00:58:07.084
Soo-a is a pretty name.

00:58:13.751 --> 00:58:17.542
- It is.
- That's it?

00:58:18.084 --> 00:58:20.001
What if it's a boy?

00:58:25.042 --> 00:58:27.876
It'll be a girl who resembles you.

00:58:45.417 --> 00:58:45.959
<i>BUSAN HOSPITAL</i>

00:58:46.042 --> 00:58:48.126
<i>- Packed your passport?
- Yes.</i>

00:58:48.209 --> 00:58:49.709
<i>Should I meet you at Seoul Station?</i>

00:58:49.792 --> 00:58:51.501
No, come to the airport.

00:58:51.584 --> 00:58:52.667
Do you miss me?

00:58:52.751 --> 00:58:55.334
<i>Of course. It's been 2 months.</i>

00:58:55.417 --> 00:59:01.334
In 9 hours and 20 minutes, we
can be together for 3 days.

00:59:01.417 --> 00:59:02.251
Yeon-a...

00:59:02.334 --> 00:59:03.501
Hmm?

00:59:03.584 --> 00:59:04.542
Be careful.

00:59:04.626 --> 00:59:07.334
Okay. See you later.

00:59:07.417 --> 00:59:08.459
Bye.

00:59:17.042 --> 00:59:18.292
Dr. HAN?

00:59:18.376 --> 00:59:20.042
Call from geriatrics.

00:59:22.001 --> 00:59:23.667
Dr. HAN speaking.

00:59:51.001 --> 00:59:53.084
Go away!

00:59:53.167 --> 00:59:57.084
Abandon me here and live
it up why don't you!

00:59:57.167 --> 01:00:01.209
You're just like your mom. That bitch!

01:00:01.292 --> 01:00:02.501
Stop it, will you?

01:00:02.584 --> 01:00:06.542
When I get my hands on
her, I'll drag her to...

01:00:06.626 --> 01:00:09.501
What did Mom do! You tortured her for life!

01:00:09.584 --> 01:00:14.501
Don't take her side! She had an affair!

01:00:15.459 --> 01:00:19.751
You're the one who cheated!
Come to your senses!

01:00:19.834 --> 01:00:24.542
She cheated on me with you!

01:00:24.626 --> 01:00:26.584
When will you stop?

01:00:26.667 --> 01:00:28.626
I've had it!

01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:33.667
I'll catch her even if I die!

01:00:33.751 --> 01:00:36.709
Bring the bitch to me now!

01:00:37.251 --> 01:00:41.667
Bring me the bitch!

01:00:41.751 --> 01:00:43.584
Ms. CHOI Yeon-a, please.

01:00:47.626 --> 01:00:49.167
It's today.

01:00:49.251 --> 01:00:50.959
The day Yeon-a dies.

01:00:51.709 --> 01:00:53.876
And Dad passes away too.

01:00:53.959 --> 01:00:56.542
How can I tell her about Dad?

01:00:58.667 --> 01:01:01.584
I was going to tell her later.

01:01:01.667 --> 01:01:02.959
I know.

01:01:03.376 --> 01:01:07.209
You pushed it off and didn't
tell her till the end.

01:01:08.459 --> 01:01:10.959
- Then the call...
- Yes.

01:01:11.709 --> 01:01:13.667
<i>I called her 30 years ago.</i>

01:01:13.751 --> 01:01:17.917
I have to cancel the trip.
Something urgent came up.

01:01:18.001 --> 01:01:19.876
<i>You're the only doctor there?</i>

01:01:19.959 --> 01:01:22.834
It's my job. I'm sorry.

01:01:22.917 --> 01:01:25.251
<i>Then take the next flight.</i>

01:01:25.334 --> 01:01:26.917
I still can't go.

01:01:27.459 --> 01:01:28.834
<i>Then I'll come to you.</i>

01:01:28.917 --> 01:01:30.251
No, don't!

01:01:31.959 --> 01:01:35.417
I'll be stuck in the hospital for 3 days.

01:01:35.501 --> 01:01:41.084
<i>But it's our vacation! We
haven't met in 2 months.</i>

01:01:41.167 --> 01:01:43.209
I have to stay with the patient.

01:01:43.292 --> 01:01:46.126
What about me? The
patient's more important?

01:01:46.209 --> 01:01:48.667
Don't say that. I'm a doctor.

01:01:48.751 --> 01:01:51.084
How can you only think of yourself?

01:01:51.167 --> 01:01:54.292
<i>I'm sorry, Yeon-a. Let's talk later.</i>

01:02:03.709 --> 01:02:04.334
Hello?

01:02:04.417 --> 01:02:06.459
<i>Yeon-a! Something's wrong!</i>

01:02:19.584 --> 01:02:20.876
What happened?

01:02:21.501 --> 01:02:24.584
She's never been like this.
What's with her?

01:02:25.417 --> 01:02:28.084
Call for help. I'll calm her down.

01:02:28.959 --> 01:02:32.501
Somebody help! Anybody there?

01:02:34.001 --> 01:02:36.501
Mingky! Good girl.

01:02:37.126 --> 01:02:38.084
Mingky?

01:02:38.167 --> 01:02:39.751
Come here!

01:02:42.542 --> 01:02:44.084
Mingky! Stop!

01:02:46.792 --> 01:02:47.959
Mingky!

01:02:54.959 --> 01:02:56.542
It's tomorrow's paper.

01:03:00.084 --> 01:03:02.709
<i>FEMALE TRAINER DIES SAVING DOLPHIN</i>

01:03:05.001 --> 01:03:06.834
There's no time.

01:03:06.917 --> 01:03:09.792
Now, it's your turn.

01:03:10.917 --> 01:03:13.126
We must change that article.

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:17.084
Ms. CHOI Yeon-a, please.

01:03:17.751 --> 01:03:18.459
<i>Hello?</i>

01:03:18.542 --> 01:03:20.459
Yeon-a...

01:03:21.751 --> 01:03:25.251
I have to cancel the trip.
Something urgent came up.

01:03:25.334 --> 01:03:27.209
<i>You're the only doctor there?</i>

01:03:27.292 --> 01:03:29.292
I'm sorry. It's my job.

01:03:29.376 --> 01:03:31.334
<i>Then take the next flight.</i>

01:03:31.417 --> 01:03:33.001
I still can't go.

01:03:33.084 --> 01:03:35.251
<i>Then I'll come to you.</i>

01:03:35.334 --> 01:03:41.376
I'll be stuck in the hospital for 3 days.

01:03:41.459 --> 01:03:43.709
I have to stay with the patient.

01:03:43.792 --> 01:03:48.959
<i>But it's our vacation! We
haven't met in 2 months!</i>

01:03:50.917 --> 01:03:52.959
Then come to me.

01:04:06.001 --> 01:04:07.917
- You came?
- Soo-hyun...

01:04:08.876 --> 01:04:10.876
Sorry to make you come.

01:04:13.084 --> 01:04:14.876
I'm so sorry.

01:04:14.959 --> 01:04:17.001
I had no idea.

01:04:25.001 --> 01:04:28.167
Let's step out. We need to talk.

01:04:33.334 --> 01:04:37.626
Why didn't you tell me?
I would've come sooner.

01:04:37.709 --> 01:04:40.126
I would've been with him when you're busy.

01:04:40.209 --> 01:04:42.876
Why would you see him?

01:04:42.959 --> 01:04:44.959
Because he's your dad.

01:04:45.042 --> 01:04:50.376
When I was young, he beat Mom all the time.

01:04:53.334 --> 01:04:57.251
He was a drunken wife abuser.

01:04:57.334 --> 01:05:00.959
- Now he's...
- It's okay.

01:05:01.042 --> 01:05:02.876
You don't have to tell me.

01:05:09.334 --> 01:05:13.167
Mom left home when I was 14.

01:05:13.251 --> 01:05:15.834
She couldn't take the beatings anymore.

01:05:15.917 --> 01:05:18.334
Then he started throwing punches at me.

01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:23.834
I wanted to run away too.

01:05:23.917 --> 01:05:30.001
But I couldn't leave in case Mom came back.

01:05:30.834 --> 01:05:33.084
I got a call when I was 18.

01:05:33.167 --> 01:05:35.042
Mom died.

01:05:38.542 --> 01:05:41.501
She hung herself where she worked.

01:05:43.501 --> 01:05:45.126
So listen.

01:05:47.501 --> 01:05:55.126
I can't make the family you dream of.

01:05:55.209 --> 01:05:56.959
I can't.

01:05:57.042 --> 01:05:58.792
- But...
- Don't you get it?

01:05:58.876 --> 01:06:01.334
Forget building a family!

01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:05.167
I just don't like you.

01:06:09.084 --> 01:06:12.042
- What?
- Ever since you wanted a baby...

01:06:12.084 --> 01:06:15.417
I think I just got sick of you.

01:06:15.501 --> 01:06:17.376
I don't like you.

01:06:17.459 --> 01:06:19.084
HAN Soo-hyun.

01:06:20.001 --> 01:06:21.709
Soo-hyun?

01:06:21.792 --> 01:06:23.251
So let's break up.

01:26:46.667 --> 01:26:48.417
Things will be okay.

01:26:49.751 --> 01:26:52.792
I lost Yeon-a and Tae-ho.
How can it be okay?

01:26:53.876 --> 01:26:55.959
Does it have to be a happy ending?

01:26:56.959 --> 01:26:59.459
The story itself is important.

01:27:00.334 --> 01:27:02.501
Just live your life to the fullest.

01:27:03.709 --> 01:27:05.584
That's not easy.

01:27:07.709 --> 01:27:10.834
This is the last time we meet.

01:27:17.667 --> 01:27:20.834
I'll miss you, HAN Soo-hyun.

01:27:20.917 --> 01:27:22.834
Young man.

01:27:22.917 --> 01:27:24.792
Now, it's your turn.

01:27:54.626 --> 01:27:55.876
Excuse me.

01:27:56.876 --> 01:27:59.167
- You dropped this.
- Thank you.

01:28:02.417 --> 01:28:06.167
<i>MAY 2nd, 1994
MET SOO-A'S MOM AT ACADEMIC CONFERENCE</i>

01:28:08.459 --> 01:28:15.167
This is the complex case of
hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

01:28:15.251 --> 01:28:18.751
<i>My third and final condition...</i>

01:28:18.834 --> 01:28:23.126
9 years from now, you'll meet
a woman at a conference.

01:28:26.126 --> 01:28:29.459
Spend some time with her.

01:28:32.417 --> 01:28:34.667
She'll be Soo-a's mother.

01:28:43.417 --> 01:28:46.917
You showed hope for children
with heart defects.

01:28:47.626 --> 01:28:49.334
You came to the conference?

01:28:50.751 --> 01:28:53.959
I'm Elaina Hong, a
cardiologist at Johns Hopkins.

01:28:54.042 --> 01:28:57.209
Nice to meet you. I'm HAN Soo-hyun.

01:28:57.292 --> 01:29:00.542
I got curious about you.

01:29:01.292 --> 01:29:03.584
Your thesis was interesting.

01:29:03.667 --> 01:29:05.459
You must love kids.

01:29:05.542 --> 01:29:07.417
I guess I do.

01:29:09.751 --> 01:29:13.209
The sea is always so pretty.

01:29:15.334 --> 01:29:17.167
So beautiful.

01:29:18.167 --> 01:29:19.334
Me?

01:29:36.251 --> 01:29:37.709
Hello?

01:29:38.209 --> 01:29:40.834
<i>It's Elaina.</i>

01:29:40.917 --> 01:29:42.376
<i>Remember me?</i>

01:29:43.167 --> 01:29:44.251
Yes.

01:29:45.626 --> 01:29:48.209
<i>Sorry to decide this on my own...</i>

01:29:51.042 --> 01:29:54.001
<i>We have a surprise gift in life.</i>

01:29:57.667 --> 01:30:01.959
<i>It's a girl. She resembles you.</i>

01:30:20.209 --> 01:30:21.626
Soo-a. We're home.

01:30:21.709 --> 01:30:23.001
No! Potato! Stay inside.

01:30:26.334 --> 01:30:29.251
Daddy was so worried.

01:30:32.626 --> 01:30:35.042
That's my book.

01:30:51.792 --> 01:30:53.834
Soo-a! Call me.

01:31:13.001 --> 01:31:14.292
Bye, Dad.

01:31:50.459 --> 01:31:52.251
You hid it well.

01:31:53.792 --> 01:31:55.792
Damn old man.

01:32:02.126 --> 01:32:03.251
Dad?

01:32:03.751 --> 01:32:04.917
Dad?

01:32:08.126 --> 01:32:09.959
Should we go inside?

01:32:10.042 --> 01:32:11.001
No.

01:32:11.417 --> 01:32:13.501
The cool air is refreshing.

01:32:16.209 --> 01:32:17.917
Soo-a...

01:32:18.001 --> 01:32:20.334
Sorry I was a clumsy dad.

01:32:20.417 --> 01:32:22.001
Don't say that.

01:32:22.501 --> 01:32:24.626
I was the stubborn one.

01:32:25.459 --> 01:32:26.667
No.

01:32:27.542 --> 01:32:30.917
I was so happy to have you as my daughter.

01:32:32.251 --> 01:32:33.459
Me too.

01:32:35.584 --> 01:32:39.001
I was lucky to have you as my dad.

01:32:43.376 --> 01:32:46.001
- Dad.
- Hmm?

01:32:47.417 --> 01:32:55.501
If I miss someone I can't
meet, what should I do then?

01:33:03.751 --> 01:33:06.209
Think of happy times together.

01:33:07.876 --> 01:33:11.376
The happiest moment with that person.

01:33:13.917 --> 01:33:16.667
The memories will make you live on.

01:33:37.334 --> 01:33:40.126
Dad? Are you crying?

01:33:40.209 --> 01:33:41.209
No.

01:33:42.626 --> 01:33:43.876
I'm not.

01:34:07.251 --> 01:34:16.292
<i>HAN SOO-HYUN (1958-2015)
REST IN PEACE, DAD
LOVE, SOO-A</i>

01:34:16.792 --> 01:34:18.792
<i>ORANGERINE</i>

01:34:19.959 --> 01:34:21.751
Try this, pal.

01:34:21.834 --> 01:34:23.667
I struck rich with it.

01:34:25.209 --> 01:34:30.959
After avoiding me for 30
years, how could you...

01:34:31.834 --> 01:34:34.792
Are you Tae-ho by chance?

01:34:36.167 --> 01:34:37.167
Who's asking?

01:34:37.251 --> 01:34:39.251
I'm HAN Soo-a.

01:34:46.792 --> 01:34:48.459
He had a daughter?

01:34:49.209 --> 01:34:50.251
Yes.

01:34:50.959 --> 01:34:53.042
Dad was right.

01:34:53.126 --> 01:34:56.417
He said you'd be the last
to leave his funeral.

01:34:56.501 --> 01:34:58.876
Your dad said that?

01:34:59.292 --> 01:35:00.292
Yes.

01:35:08.751 --> 01:35:12.876
He asked to give you this.

01:35:12.959 --> 01:35:14.751
What is it?

01:35:14.834 --> 01:35:16.417
Open it.

01:35:19.751 --> 01:35:21.167
<i>TO MY DEAR FRIEND TAE-HO</i>

01:35:41.917 --> 01:35:43.376
<i>KNOW HOW MUCH I MISSED YOU?</i>

01:35:44.167 --> 01:35:47.792
<i>YOUR FRIEND IN LIFE AND DEATH, SOO-HYUN</i>

01:36:01.917 --> 01:36:03.959
How's the Zoological Society?

01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:07.751
As usual.

01:36:08.751 --> 01:36:11.751
How's the farm?

01:36:11.834 --> 01:36:12.834
Good.

01:36:17.834 --> 01:36:20.042
Is something wrong?

01:36:20.126 --> 01:36:22.959
Did Sun-young kick you out?

01:36:23.042 --> 01:36:26.251
No, she won't do that.

01:36:31.626 --> 01:36:33.126
Yeon-a...

01:36:34.626 --> 01:36:36.959
Soo-hyun passed away.

01:36:40.001 --> 01:36:41.917
He had lung cancer.

01:36:56.251 --> 01:36:58.834
I thought I was over him.

01:37:06.251 --> 01:37:11.126
Now, I guess I have to be.

01:37:18.334 --> 01:37:21.001
How could he...

01:37:24.334 --> 01:37:25.667
Yeon-a?

01:37:25.751 --> 01:37:27.042
Read this.

01:37:50.126 --> 01:37:52.001
He went 9 times.

01:37:58.334 --> 01:38:02.792
Seven, eight... Ninth was the sea...

01:38:03.917 --> 01:38:05.417
There's one left!

01:38:13.209 --> 01:38:14.376
Soo-a!

01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:23.167
There's gotta be one left!

01:38:23.251 --> 01:38:24.459
Where is it?

01:38:29.251 --> 01:38:30.876
Where'd he leave it?

01:38:35.376 --> 01:38:37.167
His favorite song!

01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:48.084
Found it!

01:38:49.626 --> 01:38:51.417
It really exists!

01:38:56.751 --> 01:38:57.751
Hi, Yeon-a.

01:38:57.834 --> 01:39:00.334
<i>Tae-ho? What does this mean?</i>

01:39:00.417 --> 01:39:04.084
<i>- Time travelling?
- That's right.</i>

01:39:04.167 --> 01:39:05.459
<i>You expect me to believe this?</i>

01:39:05.542 --> 01:39:08.626
It's crazy, but it's true.

01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:11.709
<i>I tried to forget for 30 years.
Why are you doing this?</i>

01:39:11.792 --> 01:39:15.251
Yeon-a! I'll bring him back.

01:39:15.334 --> 01:39:16.459
<i>What?</i>

01:39:16.542 --> 01:39:17.792
I'll bring Soo-hyun back.

01:39:17.876 --> 01:39:20.292
<i>What do you mean?</i>

01:39:20.376 --> 01:39:22.501
Trust me, Yeon-a!

01:39:23.376 --> 01:39:25.292
Take the pill and sleep, huh?

01:39:33.001 --> 01:39:34.417
Gotta sleep.

01:39:47.042 --> 01:39:48.542
Why can't I sleep?

01:39:49.251 --> 01:39:50.959
Am I too anxious?

01:39:53.084 --> 01:39:54.126
What the hell!

01:40:01.626 --> 01:40:03.209
Son of a bitch!

01:40:03.292 --> 01:40:05.626
No jaywalking!

01:40:05.709 --> 01:40:07.709
I'm a cop!

01:40:07.792 --> 01:40:09.626
He just dissed me!

01:40:11.792 --> 01:40:13.209
Geeze!

01:40:13.292 --> 01:40:14.417
Who are you?

01:40:14.501 --> 01:40:16.209
Why are you here?

01:40:19.751 --> 01:40:21.209
Wow!

01:40:22.792 --> 01:40:24.292
This is for real!

01:40:24.376 --> 01:40:26.417
Real or fake!

01:40:26.501 --> 01:40:28.501
How'd you get in here?

01:40:28.584 --> 01:40:29.667
Fool!

01:40:34.626 --> 01:40:37.584
I'm sorry. Let's go to Busan Hospital.

01:40:37.667 --> 01:40:40.376
- Why there?
- Hurry up!

01:40:43.417 --> 01:40:46.667
Know this is a police car?

01:40:47.376 --> 01:40:48.501
I know.

01:40:54.584 --> 01:40:57.084
Quit smoking! Damn it!

01:40:57.167 --> 01:40:58.209
Who are you?

01:40:58.292 --> 01:40:59.167
What?

01:40:59.251 --> 01:41:01.292
Who are you to...

01:41:01.834 --> 01:41:02.834
Tae-ho!

01:41:02.917 --> 01:41:04.709
I'm KANG Tae-ho!

01:41:04.792 --> 01:41:05.459
What?

01:41:05.542 --> 01:41:08.376
Your friend KANG Tae-ho!
Don't I look the same?

01:41:10.459 --> 01:41:11.209
KANG Tae-ho?

01:41:11.292 --> 01:41:12.417
Yes, Soo-hyun!

01:41:15.792 --> 01:41:17.251
Tae-ho!

01:41:18.667 --> 01:41:21.126
It's really you!

01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:22.917
Wait.

01:41:23.751 --> 01:41:24.876
How'd you come here?

01:41:24.959 --> 01:41:28.709
I took the last pill to come.

01:41:28.792 --> 01:41:30.709
My heart is about to burst.

01:41:30.792 --> 01:41:32.459
Then you must know everything.

01:41:32.542 --> 01:41:34.709
- Yes, I do.
- I'm sorry.

01:41:34.792 --> 01:41:37.584
Stupid fool! Cold, stubborn fool!

01:41:37.667 --> 01:41:40.751
Why'd you break ties for 30
years and keep it to yourself?

01:41:40.834 --> 01:41:43.626
- We don't meet for 30 years?
- That's right!

01:41:44.751 --> 01:41:47.251
I'm sorry, pal. I had no choice.

01:41:47.334 --> 01:41:50.376
Why wait to die to tell me everything?

01:41:50.459 --> 01:41:52.209
Die?

01:41:52.292 --> 01:41:53.542
Must be time to go.

01:41:53.626 --> 01:41:56.126
It's okay, Soo-hyun.

01:41:56.209 --> 01:41:59.084
Let's meet in 30 years. Promise?

01:41:59.292 --> 01:42:04.292
Forget the last 30 years!
Let's meet again, pal.

01:42:05.542 --> 01:42:07.001
30 years is too long.

01:42:07.084 --> 01:42:11.626
No, 30 years fly by like a bullet!

01:42:11.709 --> 01:42:14.667
- I'll be waiting!
- I'm sorry.

01:42:14.751 --> 01:42:16.792
Love you, pal!

01:42:16.876 --> 01:42:19.584
Let's meet again!

01:42:23.084 --> 01:42:24.626
Thanks pal.

01:42:26.667 --> 01:42:28.251
KANG Tae-ho...

01:42:50.209 --> 01:42:51.876
What happened?

01:42:54.626 --> 01:42:56.834
Stupid fool!

01:42:56.917 --> 01:42:58.876
I'm so stupid!

01:42:58.959 --> 01:43:01.751
What if it didn't work?

01:43:05.042 --> 01:43:06.584
Soo-hyun!

01:43:06.667 --> 01:43:08.042
Soo-hyun!

01:43:09.126 --> 01:43:10.876
Crazy fool!

01:43:10.959 --> 01:43:13.126
I forgot to tell him about lung cancer!

01:43:13.209 --> 01:43:15.917
How could I forget to warn him?

01:43:16.459 --> 01:43:17.709
Soo-hyun!

01:43:17.792 --> 01:43:19.834
Soo-hyun!

01:43:47.792 --> 01:43:50.792
<i>Next stop is Seoul Grand Park.</i>

01:43:50.876 --> 01:43:56.709
<i>Please get off here for the entrance.</i>

01:43:56.792 --> 01:44:02.792
<i>Please remain seated until
the train is stopped.</i>

01:44:08.001 --> 01:44:12.501
Welcome to Seoul Grand Park, a
place of dreams and adventures!

01:44:12.584 --> 01:44:15.334
- Hello!
- Welcome to Seoul Grand Park.

01:45:46.251 --> 01:45:48.334
How long were we apart?
