WEBVTT

00:04:03.143 --> 00:04:05.018
Excuse me, something
is happening...

00:04:05.727 --> 00:04:06.892
What the...?

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:51.642
It's him!

00:06:52.935 --> 00:06:55.268
Get him up!
Why the hell are you so weak?

00:06:56.227 --> 00:06:58.977
- Pilot, get him to the stairs!
- Come on!

00:07:28.685 --> 00:07:29.893
Hurry!

00:07:34.101 --> 00:07:36.934
- Move your feet!
- He's shell-shocked!

00:08:01.267 --> 00:08:03.809
Freaking Astronomer,
it's impossible to understand.

00:08:03.852 --> 00:08:05.019
Come on!

00:08:05.643 --> 00:08:06.685
Hurry!

00:08:07.684 --> 00:08:09.350
Just follow us,
understand?

00:08:16.102 --> 00:08:17.602
Come on, jump!

00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:55.559
Hurry!

00:09:07.852 --> 00:09:09.685
Let's go!

00:09:34.185 --> 00:09:35.935
Come on.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.061
That's it.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.768
We're done for.

00:09:46.809 --> 00:09:48.893
Told you so.
Told you...

00:10:00.727 --> 00:10:01.851
Don't...

00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:20.309
We're out of time!

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.935
Off you go.

00:10:25.851 --> 00:10:27.851
I can't carry you any longer.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.726
Wait!

00:10:54.268 --> 00:10:56.101
Who the hell are you?

00:10:57.727 --> 00:10:59.560
Where are we going?

00:11:03.684 --> 00:11:05.643
You wanna stay?

00:11:36.142 --> 00:11:39.100
- What happened to me?
- How would I know?

00:11:39.768 --> 00:11:42.184
Car accident
or maybe an OD...

00:11:43.644 --> 00:11:45.310
Am I dead?

00:11:45.352 --> 00:11:46.809
Coma.

00:11:47.268 --> 00:11:49.267
You mean this is all
a dream?

00:11:50.017 --> 00:11:51.852
Memories.

00:11:52.143 --> 00:11:55.184
- Whose?
- Everyone who's in a coma.

00:11:56.184 --> 00:11:59.643
Everyone who's in a coma
comes to the same place-- here.

00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:01.809
Our brain creates
a field of memories.

00:12:01.852 --> 00:12:04.602
When in a coma, it switches off
and adjusts to this field.

00:12:04.643 --> 00:12:07.769
Like how a radio
picks up signals. Look.

00:12:09.185 --> 00:12:14.142
Buildings, objects, people...
Whatever we remember is here.

00:12:14.185 --> 00:12:17.726
Whatever we don't remember
simply doesn't exist.

00:12:17.768 --> 00:12:19.893
So there you have it.

00:12:19.935 --> 00:12:21.851
Memories...

00:12:46.726 --> 00:12:48.059
It doesn't makes sense.

00:12:48.894 --> 00:12:50.811
What about the ones that...

00:12:50.851 --> 00:12:53.559
They aren't people. I'm
telling you, they're memories.

00:12:53.602 --> 00:12:55.560
Ok, and what about
those black creatures?

00:12:55.601 --> 00:12:57.351
Are those memories, too?

00:12:57.643 --> 00:12:58.934
Hold on!

00:13:01.811 --> 00:13:03.559
Hold on.

00:13:16.892 --> 00:13:18.351
Soldier Fly!

00:13:19.059 --> 00:13:22.101
Are you going to secure
the perimeter or should I?

00:13:22.142 --> 00:13:23.768
I already did.

00:13:23.811 --> 00:13:25.644
Do it again then.

00:13:28.601 --> 00:13:30.892
Listen,
where are we going anyway?

00:13:54.975 --> 00:13:57.309
- Wait, does it fly?
- Get in already.

00:14:13.018 --> 00:14:14.851
It's a wormhole.
That happens sometimes.

00:14:14.892 --> 00:14:16.643
Someone remembered the bus
near the building

00:14:16.684 --> 00:14:18.309
and someone else
in the field.

00:14:18.892 --> 00:14:21.017
The memories are mixed up.

00:14:28.809 --> 00:14:31.101
Where is he?
Where is Pilot?

00:14:33.727 --> 00:14:36.018
He had to distract the Reaper
with a whistle.

00:14:36.059 --> 00:14:37.975
We wouldn't have
gotten out otherwise.

00:14:40.686 --> 00:14:43.727
- You left... You left him?!
- Hey!

00:14:43.976 --> 00:14:46.143
Didn't I tell you how
dangerous that district is?

00:14:46.185 --> 00:14:48.018
And that map was bullshit.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.018
There wasn't enough time,
I told you.

00:14:50.059 --> 00:14:52.017
You were rushing me!
Everything has changed there.

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.602
Why did we have to go there
in the first place?

00:14:58.809 --> 00:15:01.018
I'm absolutely sure...

00:15:02.768 --> 00:15:04.892
...it was worth it.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.935
Fly, show him around.
And get him settled in upstairs.

00:15:13.727 --> 00:15:14.893
Let's go.

00:15:22.102 --> 00:15:24.143
The show's over!
Chop-chop!

00:15:24.184 --> 00:15:27.059
Tank, what's up
with the trail?

00:15:27.102 --> 00:15:28.601
Are you waiting for the Reapers
to come over?

00:15:28.644 --> 00:15:29.226
Blow it up already!

00:15:29.268 --> 00:15:30.767
But we're running low
on explosives.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:32.309
We need to ration.

00:15:32.352 --> 00:15:35.142
Ration my ass.
Didn't you see how they jump?

00:15:40.267 --> 00:15:43.268
We blow up all the trails
around the building.

00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:46.643
But someone always remembers
them, so they reappear again.

00:15:46.685 --> 00:15:48.059
In order to stop the Reapers,

00:15:48.101 --> 00:15:49.935
we always have to be
on high alert.

00:15:49.977 --> 00:15:51.726
We take turns keeping watch.

00:15:53.101 --> 00:15:57.226
Yan says there's a whole island
here in Coma free of Reapers.

00:15:57.644 --> 00:16:00.851
We're always looking for those
who can help us get there.

00:16:01.102 --> 00:16:03.892
He's very certain about you
for some reason.

00:16:03.935 --> 00:16:05.227
You need to eat
and drink here.

00:16:05.268 --> 00:16:07.268
Hunger and cold
are all memories

00:16:07.309 --> 00:16:09.268
but everything is like
in reality,

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:11.143
so we have to go outside.

00:16:11.184 --> 00:16:13.559
Those from the squad with
abilities are sent there.

00:16:13.601 --> 00:16:16.101
- I don't remember my name.
- Nobody does.

00:16:16.143 --> 00:16:17.102
By the way,
give yourself a nickname

00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:18.851
before somebody else does.

00:16:18.892 --> 00:16:21.184
- It's just a dream.
- Let's go.

00:16:21.226 --> 00:16:22.559
To wake up,
it's just a room...

00:16:22.601 --> 00:16:23.643
Hey!

00:16:24.142 --> 00:16:26.934
Someone just died
to save you.

00:16:27.643 --> 00:16:29.892
You can't wake up.
Do you understand?

00:16:29.934 --> 00:16:31.976
Your body is in a coma
somewhere. You're here.

00:16:32.018 --> 00:16:33.767
There's nothing you
can do about it.

00:16:46.101 --> 00:16:48.310
And what is that?

00:16:52.142 --> 00:16:53.935
Dreams.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.851
They materialize
while we're asleep.

00:16:56.893 --> 00:16:59.310
This way we can remember
something from reality.

00:17:00.934 --> 00:17:02.601
You'll get used to it.

00:17:03.767 --> 00:17:07.017
Gnome lives there,
Tank, then Spirit,

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.059
Astronomer, me and Phantom.
The rest live downstairs.

00:17:09.102 --> 00:17:11.102
You'll receive clothes
and ammo from Tank.

00:17:11.143 --> 00:17:13.268
You and Phantom
are together?

00:17:13.726 --> 00:17:15.017
What?

00:17:26.101 --> 00:17:27.767
It's empty.

00:17:28.227 --> 00:17:31.269
Spend a couple of weeks here
and it'll start to take shape.

00:17:31.642 --> 00:17:33.601
It's yours.
Go inside.

00:17:37.725 --> 00:17:40.309
Usually a newcomer
goes through an initiation.

00:17:40.352 --> 00:17:43.685
But Yan decided to put you here
with the squad right away.

00:17:43.725 --> 00:17:48.269
Ah, the man from the balcony.
Is he a leader of some sort?

00:17:48.643 --> 00:17:51.060
He's been living here
longer than anybody else.

00:17:51.602 --> 00:17:53.269
He's left Coma once.

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:54.977
That's why we know
what this world is like.

00:17:55.018 --> 00:17:56.726
He taught us how
to survive here.

00:17:56.768 --> 00:17:58.893
We owe him our lives.

00:17:58.934 --> 00:18:00.767
Including you.

00:18:02.935 --> 00:18:04.561
Ok, get some rest.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.934
We'll see what you're
made of tomorrow.

00:18:11.976 --> 00:18:14.144
And Phantom and I
are not together.

00:18:14.684 --> 00:18:17.601
- I didn't mean to...
- Even though he thinks we are.

00:18:18.143 --> 00:18:20.102
That's not how it is.

00:20:29.019 --> 00:20:30.643
Wow!

00:20:32.184 --> 00:20:34.601
Looks like you really
are a phenomenon.

00:20:36.185 --> 00:20:38.060
Don't even think
of going there.

00:20:39.226 --> 00:20:42.600
Dreams are tricky.
You can get lost.

00:20:43.311 --> 00:20:45.643
You won't be able
to get out of there.

00:20:45.685 --> 00:20:48.144
So, how are you?
Are you settling in ok?

00:20:49.269 --> 00:20:51.727
- I guess so.
- Don't bullshit me.

00:20:53.102 --> 00:20:54.976
Everyone goes crazy
at first in here.

00:20:55.018 --> 00:20:58.185
Listen, I was a little hard
on you back there.

00:21:00.184 --> 00:21:03.268
- No hard feelings, ok?
- Yeah, all good.

00:21:05.018 --> 00:21:06.226
Peace?

00:21:08.019 --> 00:21:09.269
Peace.

00:21:10.144 --> 00:21:11.727
You see,

00:21:12.685 --> 00:21:15.768
Yan is trying to
find this island of his.

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:18.102
Points out to some
chosen ones.

00:21:19.059 --> 00:21:22.727
It's not my business really.
I'm not against it.

00:21:22.767 --> 00:21:27.269
I have people to take care of.
The discipline, subordination...

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:29.809
I understand.
Got it.

00:21:31.102 --> 00:21:32.727
Good man.

00:21:34.351 --> 00:21:36.144
I liked you from the start.

00:21:37.059 --> 00:21:39.019
You're smarter
than the others.

00:21:40.018 --> 00:21:42.184
So stay away from my girl.

00:21:42.767 --> 00:21:44.642
I like her.

00:21:45.601 --> 00:21:47.809
She's acting out.

00:21:48.184 --> 00:21:51.268
But that's ok.
We're almost there.

00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:53.351
Well, I wouldn't say that.

00:22:00.184 --> 00:22:04.224
Yan might see
something in you.

00:22:03.268 --> 00:22:07.350
But he's made
mistakes in the past.

00:22:10.727 --> 00:22:14.269
And again,
I lead the squad.

00:22:14.768 --> 00:22:16.311
Not him.

00:22:16.852 --> 00:22:20.269
We're supposed to be friends,
and you're rude.

00:22:20.977 --> 00:22:24.226
No, I just wanted to say that
she should decide for herself.

00:22:29.852 --> 00:22:32.768
You haven't figured
shit out yet.

00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:35.602
- Stand up.
- What for?

00:22:39.018 --> 00:22:40.976
Stand up, soldier!

00:22:42.685 --> 00:22:45.183
Chop-chop!

00:22:44.601 --> 00:22:47.809
Everyone's tired
of waiting for you.

00:23:06.059 --> 00:23:09.767
Some people develop unique
abilities here in Coma.

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:11.810
It all depends on
their way of thinking

00:23:11.851 --> 00:23:13.976
and predisposition.

00:23:14.768 --> 00:23:17.852
Spirit, for instance,
senses Reapers from afar

00:23:17.893 --> 00:23:19.684
and invokes ghosts.

00:23:19.726 --> 00:23:21.726
Astronomer draws the routes.

00:23:21.768 --> 00:23:24.269
Pilot can locate
real people in Coma.

00:23:24.309 --> 00:23:25.768
In order to discover
those abilities,

00:23:25.809 --> 00:23:27.977
a person needs a push.

00:23:28.851 --> 00:23:30.851
Needs to be put in danger.

00:23:47.102 --> 00:23:49.226
Let's see why you
are so special.

00:23:50.268 --> 00:23:51.977
Gnome, launch a half!

00:24:13.934 --> 00:24:16.018
Hey!
Get it together!

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.393
Do something!

00:24:32.934 --> 00:24:34.893
So far so bad.

00:24:35.893 --> 00:24:39.060
But you know,
often the abilities...

00:24:39.726 --> 00:24:42.059
...flourish in real combat.
There, outside.

00:24:42.102 --> 00:24:44.060
That's how it happened to me,
for instance.

00:24:44.768 --> 00:24:47.810
But we aren't animals who put
you in real combat right away.

00:24:48.726 --> 00:24:50.769
Gnome has built me...

00:24:51.268 --> 00:24:53.267
...a training machine.

00:24:53.642 --> 00:24:55.018
Bring out your dummy,
Gnome!

00:25:00.809 --> 00:25:02.727
I said, bring it out.

00:25:51.018 --> 00:25:53.018
It's the enemy!
Attack!

00:26:00.392 --> 00:26:01.934
Fight!

00:26:04.061 --> 00:26:05.976
Fight!
You can do it!

00:26:38.643 --> 00:26:40.768
So you can't act
on anything?

00:26:50.142 --> 00:26:52.225
What did you do for a living?

00:26:52.936 --> 00:26:55.225
I was an architect,
I think.

00:26:56.768 --> 00:26:59.352
Cable!
Take the rookie.

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:03.184
We've never had
an architect.

00:28:17.643 --> 00:28:20.142
Afternoon shift!
Wake up!

00:28:20.726 --> 00:28:24.017
Afternoon shift!
Get to work!

00:28:47.185 --> 00:28:48.894
Higher!

00:28:49.601 --> 00:28:51.184
Ok, secure it!

00:28:57.726 --> 00:28:59.017
Cable!

00:28:59.059 --> 00:29:02.017
We're going to your submarine
to get the explosives.

00:29:02.059 --> 00:29:03.810
Seems like we've cleared up
everything here.

00:29:03.852 --> 00:29:04.935
Get ready.

00:29:04.976 --> 00:29:06.601
Yes, Commander!

00:29:10.059 --> 00:29:12.100
Keep working, Architect.

00:29:13.727 --> 00:29:15.267
We don't need freeloaders.

00:29:30.101 --> 00:29:31.602
Hey.

00:29:32.185 --> 00:29:34.769
Stop sitting around!
Who's going to work?

00:29:37.934 --> 00:29:39.601
Why are you upset?

00:29:39.644 --> 00:29:42.267
You should be happy, you fool.
You're lucky!

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:45.310
And why am I lucky?

00:29:47.101 --> 00:29:50.934
You may not have these
valuable super powers, so what?

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:56.352
Look, there are plenty of us
who didn't pass the test.

00:29:56.644 --> 00:29:58.644
We were mistakenly picked.

00:29:59.102 --> 00:30:01.267
At least we don't
have to go out there.

00:30:01.935 --> 00:30:03.268
You'll be safer!

00:30:04.685 --> 00:30:06.934
So live your life!

00:30:06.975 --> 00:30:12.768
And you will come out of the
coma and continue on your path.

00:30:14.851 --> 00:30:17.184
But you will have to wait
for a while.

00:30:19.017 --> 00:30:21.142
Time flows differently here.

00:30:21.935 --> 00:30:24.602
We're not entirely sure,
but it seems like...

00:30:25.268 --> 00:30:28.102
...it's no less than 1 to 100.

00:30:28.892 --> 00:30:31.850
One day in reality is equal
to several months in Coma.

00:30:31.892 --> 00:30:32.810
I've been here
for 15 years,

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:35.101
but you can live here
for thousands.

00:30:36.227 --> 00:30:38.102
The question is,

00:30:39.142 --> 00:30:41.643
how do you want
to spend these thousand years?

00:30:41.685 --> 00:30:44.934
You saved me.
Tell me what my purpose is here?

00:30:44.975 --> 00:30:46.893
It doesn't matter.

00:30:46.934 --> 00:30:49.684
Who you want to be
is for you to decide.

00:30:49.727 --> 00:30:52.060
You can move hardware
all your life

00:30:52.101 --> 00:30:54.769
or you can develop
your abilities...

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:56.268
But sometimes...

00:30:56.684 --> 00:31:00.267
Sometimes it's hard to recognize
them in the beginning.

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:02.811
A person can feel like
he can do something

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:04.809
and then nothing
comes out of it.

00:31:06.602 --> 00:31:10.226
I think I finished
a building in town,

00:31:10.267 --> 00:31:12.892
but I don't know how.

00:31:12.934 --> 00:31:16.018
I tried to build something here
but it didn't work out.

00:31:20.226 --> 00:31:22.185
Phantom wasn't lying.

00:31:22.601 --> 00:31:25.309
Abilities can develop out there.

00:31:26.602 --> 00:31:29.726
We don't put the newbies
out there, too risky.

00:31:29.768 --> 00:31:33.142
But it's a personal choice.
In his case...

00:31:33.726 --> 00:31:35.934
...it worked:

00:31:35.976 --> 00:31:38.060
superhuman strength, speed.

00:31:38.101 --> 00:31:40.101
He became a leader here.

00:31:40.142 --> 00:31:42.142
I've seen a lot of people
come through here

00:31:42.184 --> 00:31:45.184
and I think we're here
for a reason.

00:31:45.768 --> 00:31:49.767
Everyone who's here
didn't make it in reality.

00:31:50.726 --> 00:31:53.184
They didn't have
a future there.

00:31:54.685 --> 00:31:56.767
I don't remember
anything about myself.

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:59.018
Just some fragments
of memories.

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.059
Maybe that's for the best.

00:32:01.101 --> 00:32:02.559
In which way?

00:32:02.602 --> 00:32:03.935
Without the heavy burden
of memories,

00:32:03.977 --> 00:32:06.142
we can have a fresh start.

00:32:06.892 --> 00:32:10.060
Nobody will tell you
who you are but yourself.

00:32:10.644 --> 00:32:13.060
This world is made
of our thoughts.

00:32:13.767 --> 00:32:16.767
- The rules are slightly different here.
- Grip it firmly.

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:18.977
And here, unlike reality,

00:32:19.768 --> 00:32:22.268
one can achieve
whatever one wants.

00:32:29.143 --> 00:32:33.269
But that doesn't mean that
you should do nothing.

00:32:37.017 --> 00:32:39.226
The sight doesn't shift
anywhere. Got it?

00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:41.977
- Yeah.
- Get your palm closer to you.

00:32:44.102 --> 00:32:45.643
What do you want?

00:32:46.101 --> 00:32:48.101
I'm going with you.

00:32:48.143 --> 00:32:51.269
What?
You want to join us?

00:32:51.309 --> 00:32:52.850
Take the rookie.

00:32:55.767 --> 00:32:57.309
What the fuck for?

00:32:57.351 --> 00:32:59.768
Because I said so.

00:33:01.018 --> 00:33:02.686
He'll get killed.

00:33:03.059 --> 00:33:06.643
So be it. We have enough
people to move hardware.

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:14.851
So look...

00:33:15.601 --> 00:33:17.684
I got it, thanks.

00:33:19.851 --> 00:33:20.726
Astronomer...

00:33:20.768 --> 00:33:23.602
Excuse me,
can somebody give me a gun?

00:34:29.809 --> 00:34:32.268
There's Gnome's tunnel.
We turn there.

00:34:32.309 --> 00:34:34.351
Yes!
There's my tunnel.

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:42.185
I'm sorry,
but why is it "Gnome's tunnel"?

00:34:42.226 --> 00:34:44.268
Because I remember it.

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:48.226
And I remember that beauty
that we're on our way to see.

00:34:48.269 --> 00:34:50.561
This world is made up
of memories.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.226
Sometimes it can be easy to
figure out who they belong to.

00:34:53.268 --> 00:34:55.809
Astronomer has this
whole theory about it.

00:34:55.852 --> 00:34:57.643
Ask him.
It's nuts!

00:34:57.685 --> 00:34:59.352
Tell us, Astronomer.

00:35:00.642 --> 00:35:02.725
- I heard you have a lot of them?
- Dreams?

00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:04.934
- Yeah, in your room.
- Well, yeah.

00:35:06.351 --> 00:35:09.684
The coma separates
consciousness and body.

00:35:09.726 --> 00:35:13.810
We lose our memories here.
We lose ourselves.

00:35:13.852 --> 00:35:14.768
Get it?

00:35:14.809 --> 00:35:17.143
- So?
- But our dreams

00:35:17.184 --> 00:35:19.560
hold all the information about

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.226
what we've remembered
during life.

00:35:21.269 --> 00:35:25.809
Even this place, where we
are now, exists there.

00:35:25.851 --> 00:35:28.351
You can find yourself
dreaming there.

00:35:28.851 --> 00:35:31.268
Ah, so that way you can
come out of the coma?

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:33.018
What are you talking about?

00:35:33.268 --> 00:35:34.309
Yan told you.

00:35:34.352 --> 00:35:36.977
Anyone who tries to enter
the dreams won't make it.

00:35:37.017 --> 00:35:40.101
- What's so hard to get?
- Doesn't mean it's impossible.

00:35:40.143 --> 00:35:41.893
Did anyone
ask your opinion?

00:35:42.143 --> 00:35:42.934
Reapers!

00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:52.892
Nah, nah, nah.
It's safe.

00:35:52.934 --> 00:35:55.018
It's a two-day
detour from there.

00:35:58.018 --> 00:36:00.351
- Can they see us?
- They sense us.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.309
We emit a signal,
a frequency.

00:36:04.018 --> 00:36:07.060
- That's why I made the whistle.
- What whistle?

00:36:07.102 --> 00:36:09.642
Just in case,
so we don't all blow up.

00:36:09.684 --> 00:36:12.101
- Only one of us.
- Like Pilot.

00:36:12.144 --> 00:36:15.309
You switch on the whistle
and it attracts the Reapers.

00:36:15.351 --> 00:36:18.351
Then you blow yourself up
with dynamite.

00:36:21.017 --> 00:36:22.684
If this world is made
of memories,

00:36:22.727 --> 00:36:25.143
how did they get here?

00:36:25.185 --> 00:36:26.768
Through us.

00:36:30.017 --> 00:36:31.642
How?

00:36:32.851 --> 00:36:34.601
Coma patients.

00:36:35.017 --> 00:36:38.809
Their brain is dead
but life support is still on.

00:36:38.852 --> 00:36:41.144
The relatives are
against turning it off.

00:36:41.185 --> 00:36:43.685
The dead brain creates them.

00:36:44.019 --> 00:36:45.852
They die...

00:36:46.269 --> 00:36:48.685
...and decay all the time.

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:51.642
But they have the ability
to turn the living into

00:36:51.685 --> 00:36:53.810
the same black shit
they are made of.

00:36:53.852 --> 00:36:56.310
I'd rather be taken off the
machine than end up like that.

00:36:56.351 --> 00:36:58.727
Enough of that!
Let's go!

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:15.060
There's our main attraction!

00:37:27.685 --> 00:37:30.311
Architect,
did you bring spare underwear?

00:37:30.352 --> 00:37:33.019
Yeah, they're trigger-happy
with their guns.

00:37:33.059 --> 00:37:34.642
- Who?
- The guards.

00:37:34.684 --> 00:37:37.143
- Memories.
- Why would they shoot us?

00:37:37.184 --> 00:37:40.600
They shoot at strangers.
That's how I remembered it.

00:37:40.643 --> 00:37:42.727
Ok, take this.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:46.768
Turn this and
it'll enhance your bio-signal.

00:37:47.018 --> 00:37:49.101
It'll attract the Reapers,
like bees to honey.

00:37:49.685 --> 00:37:51.227
- Got it.
- Don't worry.

00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:53.102
There are no Reapers here.

00:37:53.144 --> 00:37:55.144
But don't start shooting
for no reason.

00:37:55.184 --> 00:37:56.684
You're so boring,
Astronomer.

00:37:56.727 --> 00:37:57.934
We run a greater risk
of dying from boredom

00:37:57.976 --> 00:38:00.184
than from the Reapers.

00:38:00.226 --> 00:38:02.143
Enough chewing the fat!

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:04.893
I'm leading.
Tank, stay behind and cover me.

00:38:04.935 --> 00:38:07.892
Spirit, distract them.

00:38:07.935 --> 00:38:09.269
The rest of you reserves,

00:38:09.311 --> 00:38:11.768
stay in the back
for your own safety.

00:38:12.227 --> 00:38:14.684
Any questions?
No questions.

00:38:14.934 --> 00:38:16.601
Let's go!

00:38:34.602 --> 00:38:35.310
Freeze!

00:39:08.102 --> 00:39:11.351
Did you work here?
What is this place?

00:39:11.393 --> 00:39:12.685
A lot of factories
are mixed up in here.

00:39:12.727 --> 00:39:14.685
Combined memories
of many people.

00:39:14.727 --> 00:39:16.144
There!

00:39:16.602 --> 00:39:17.894
There's the hangar!

00:39:17.934 --> 00:39:21.060
I remember now!
There's a secret door.

00:39:21.767 --> 00:39:23.934
They will leave now.

00:39:23.977 --> 00:39:26.894
We have 30 seconds
to get there.

00:39:29.685 --> 00:39:31.851
Not yet, Phantom!
Phantom!

00:39:40.726 --> 00:39:42.019
Come on!

00:40:03.727 --> 00:40:05.227
- Come on!
- Freeze!

00:40:17.102 --> 00:40:19.018
Tank, throw a grenade!

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:22.268
- It's too far, I won't make it!
- You'll make it! Throw it!

00:40:53.185 --> 00:40:54.350
Tank!

00:40:54.727 --> 00:40:56.102
Cover me!

00:40:57.894 --> 00:40:59.810
Stay back, Tank!

00:41:48.935 --> 00:41:50.685
Whoo-hoo!

00:41:53.684 --> 00:41:54.935
Get down!

00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:03.642
Spirit!

00:42:19.061 --> 00:42:20.352
Here...

00:42:45.143 --> 00:42:46.352
Uh-huh.

00:43:07.769 --> 00:43:10.393
What the hell was that!

00:43:10.935 --> 00:43:13.100
You're going to get
us all killed!

00:43:15.142 --> 00:43:17.184
What the hell do you know?

00:43:18.351 --> 00:43:22.309
- Relax!
- We've summoned the Reapers here!

00:43:22.977 --> 00:43:25.894
- Spirit?
- I can't sense them yet.

00:43:30.351 --> 00:43:31.977
See?

00:43:32.768 --> 00:43:34.184
No one's gonna hurt you.

00:43:39.685 --> 00:43:42.352
If you ever shout
at me again,

00:43:42.392 --> 00:43:44.726
I will break you in half.

00:43:45.976 --> 00:43:48.684
I'm in charge here!

00:43:50.019 --> 00:43:52.351
Do you disagree?

00:43:52.393 --> 00:43:54.351
I can't hear you!

00:43:59.351 --> 00:44:00.769
Yes!

00:44:00.809 --> 00:44:02.059
Got it!

00:44:07.101 --> 00:44:08.810
You ok?

00:44:26.227 --> 00:44:29.100
I definitely don't
recall that.

00:44:34.601 --> 00:44:36.309
Each of those torpedoes
has explosives.

00:44:36.352 --> 00:44:38.268
That will last
for a month.

00:44:39.018 --> 00:44:40.685
Get to work.

00:44:41.184 --> 00:44:42.852
On it!

00:44:49.352 --> 00:44:51.977
Come on, come on!

00:44:52.018 --> 00:44:54.601
Come on!
Easy, easy!

00:44:55.602 --> 00:44:57.060
Easy!

00:44:57.101 --> 00:45:00.268
Slowly up!
Come on, come on!

00:45:09.685 --> 00:45:11.352
Let me heal it.

00:45:12.726 --> 00:45:13.852
It's nothing.

00:45:13.893 --> 00:45:16.184
Come on.
I'll check your hand as well.

00:45:16.894 --> 00:45:18.935
I said it's nothing!

00:45:24.018 --> 00:45:25.685
Thanks.

00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:28.726
Careful!

00:45:28.768 --> 00:45:30.768
Careful!
Hold it tighter!

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:35.601
Just a slight knock
and it'll blow everything up!

00:45:42.268 --> 00:45:43.976
Fucking Coma!

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:48.726
I recognize this.
It's some country...

00:45:49.227 --> 00:45:52.101
...but I can't remember which.

00:46:03.142 --> 00:46:04.726
What's up?

00:46:09.934 --> 00:46:12.935
Everything is like
a dream here, right?

00:46:14.602 --> 00:46:16.185
A dream.

00:46:17.601 --> 00:46:21.267
You think you can grasp it...

00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:32.017
- Reapers!
- I told you so.

00:46:34.059 --> 00:46:35.601
How far?

00:46:36.685 --> 00:46:39.644
- About a third of a mile!
- Get it down!

00:46:40.018 --> 00:46:41.769
I can't!

00:46:42.268 --> 00:46:44.310
One more minute!

00:46:44.601 --> 00:46:46.934
- Get down!
- I said one minute!

00:46:46.975 --> 00:46:48.309
Freaking commander!

00:46:48.811 --> 00:46:51.310
- I'll finish it myself.
- Ok.

00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:06.935
He won't make it.

00:47:06.975 --> 00:47:09.017
Are you happy now?

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:19.142
Hold it for as long as
you can, buddy. Got it?

00:47:22.643 --> 00:47:24.975
Gnome stays here,
the rest follow me!

00:47:25.017 --> 00:47:27.768
- He can't get it down by himself!
- Cable is up there!

00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:30.101
No discussions,
obey the order!

00:47:30.142 --> 00:47:33.268
On three. One, two,

00:47:33.309 --> 00:47:35.101
three. Run!

00:47:45.685 --> 00:47:47.809
Stop! Hold it!

00:47:56.018 --> 00:47:58.101
I said hold it!

00:47:58.892 --> 00:48:00.143
Run!

00:48:01.644 --> 00:48:02.935
Come back!

00:48:03.352 --> 00:48:05.310
- Come on!
- Come back!

00:48:10.769 --> 00:48:12.769
Everyone come back!

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:30.644
Fucker!

00:48:31.601 --> 00:48:33.351
Don't you dare!

00:48:59.934 --> 00:49:01.809
Move it to the exit.

00:49:02.726 --> 00:49:04.017
Hurry!

00:49:33.725 --> 00:49:37.268
So then I look,
you guys are running,

00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:39.809
the stupid thing starts to slide
down, dragging me with it.

00:49:39.851 --> 00:49:43.686
As I'm riding it,
I'm thinking, "This is it."

00:49:43.726 --> 00:49:47.351
But then the sparks,
this ramp... Boom!

00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:52.560
My first thought was,
"I'm dead, it exploded."

00:49:52.602 --> 00:49:56.685
Who the hell knows how you trip
out while dying in a coma?

00:49:56.725 --> 00:49:58.684
Architect, you fool!

00:49:58.725 --> 00:50:02.184
Why didn't you run like the
rest? It was an order.

00:50:04.685 --> 00:50:06.310
That makes me think...

00:50:18.725 --> 00:50:23.101
That means you can build a wall
where necessary during combat?

00:50:23.892 --> 00:50:25.185
Yes.

00:50:27.018 --> 00:50:29.725
And maybe a bridge
of sorts?

00:50:32.852 --> 00:50:35.143
I guess a bridge as well.

00:50:42.017 --> 00:50:43.809
Attaboy!

00:50:44.809 --> 00:50:47.184
You will be useful
for the unit, Architect.

00:50:49.184 --> 00:50:52.601
We'll get to places
we didn't dare think of before.

00:50:52.934 --> 00:50:54.767
And I'm thinking...

00:50:55.684 --> 00:50:58.852
...there's a better way
to use his abilities.

00:51:02.269 --> 00:51:04.143
We've been looking
for a hiding place

00:51:04.185 --> 00:51:05.852
from the Reapers
for a long time.

00:51:05.892 --> 00:51:07.809
An isolated place.

00:51:07.852 --> 00:51:11.810
But we couldn't, because people
not only remember a place,

00:51:13.184 --> 00:51:15.351
but how they got there,
as well.

00:51:15.851 --> 00:51:17.767
Isn't that right,
Astronomer?

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:22.685
But what if the place
wasn't created from memory,

00:51:22.935 --> 00:51:24.352
but rather from imagination.

00:51:25.059 --> 00:51:26.851
If it's created,

00:51:26.892 --> 00:51:30.268
designed like that ramp
on which Cable fell,

00:51:31.017 --> 00:51:34.852
then it isn't intertwined
with other memories.

00:51:35.227 --> 00:51:37.268
And therefore safe.

00:51:39.226 --> 00:51:40.893
I told you,

00:51:40.935 --> 00:51:43.600
I will bring you to the island.

00:51:43.892 --> 00:51:46.143
And he will build it for us.

00:51:52.935 --> 00:51:55.852
You think he can do it?
A whole island?

00:51:57.726 --> 00:51:59.185
Can you?

00:52:09.184 --> 00:52:10.934
Um...

00:52:10.977 --> 00:52:12.685
Yes, I can.

00:52:15.934 --> 00:52:18.685
The best time to deploy
is right now.

00:52:20.059 --> 00:52:23.017
Yan, don't you want to
run it by me first?

00:52:23.268 --> 00:52:27.059
- We need time to prepare.
- What do you say, Astronomer?

00:52:28.809 --> 00:52:32.309
If we're deploying
along with the civilians,

00:52:32.767 --> 00:52:35.976
then we need to pick
the safest route.

00:52:37.226 --> 00:52:39.977
- We haven't had one in a long time.
- Hey, theorist!

00:52:40.017 --> 00:52:42.394
- It's all on paper, Yan.
- Didn't we...

00:52:42.851 --> 00:52:45.226
...clear all the explosives
in the area?

00:52:45.685 --> 00:52:48.226
Where will we go
when we run out?

00:52:48.684 --> 00:52:51.184
Sooner or later Reapers will
see the people through the bus.

00:52:51.227 --> 00:52:53.268
What then?

00:52:53.726 --> 00:52:55.227
We leave tomorrow.

00:52:56.893 --> 00:52:59.060
Astronomer will lead
the squad.

00:53:05.101 --> 00:53:06.184
Yan...

00:53:06.226 --> 00:53:10.184
Yan, I might've
overstepped today, but...

00:53:10.226 --> 00:53:13.059
You were reckless.

00:53:13.976 --> 00:53:15.642
Attracted the Reapers.

00:53:15.684 --> 00:53:18.059
That wasn't the agreement.

00:53:18.102 --> 00:53:19.852
It's my place!

00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:24.727
This mission is way
too important.

00:53:25.810 --> 00:53:27.685
Important mission?

00:53:27.935 --> 00:53:30.810
Maybe they deserve
to know something more?

00:53:30.852 --> 00:53:33.018
We will talk later!

00:53:55.727 --> 00:53:58.102
Why aren't we drinking, huh?

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:07.143
Tomorrow is a big day.
Right, Architect?

00:54:49.102 --> 00:54:51.227
Damn it!

00:54:51.268 --> 00:54:53.018
What are you doing?

00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:56.019
Shit, you scared me.
Nothing, just trying something.

00:54:58.934 --> 00:55:00.892
Trying to build?

00:55:01.976 --> 00:55:03.726
Well yeah, trying.

00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:07.102
Can I watch?

00:55:07.143 --> 00:55:09.726
I'm almost done, actually.

00:55:13.268 --> 00:55:14.851
It's not working out?

00:55:16.352 --> 00:55:18.185
No, not at all.

00:55:21.019 --> 00:55:24.144
Why did you tell everyone
you'll build that island?

00:55:30.269 --> 00:55:33.226
Back at the submarine
you called everyone back.

00:55:33.268 --> 00:55:35.767
You weren't sure
it would work.

00:55:36.351 --> 00:55:37.977
You could've killed everyone.

00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:42.018
But it worked.

00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:43.726
You've gotten by
so far without me...

00:55:43.768 --> 00:55:45.726
Just figure out
what went wrong.

00:55:45.768 --> 00:55:47.310
Wait!
You were concentrated.

00:55:47.351 --> 00:55:50.019
You did something with your
hands and something appeared.

00:55:50.059 --> 00:55:52.726
Yes, and the ramp appeared.
Why are you saying that now?

00:55:52.768 --> 00:55:54.894
No, the blueprint appeared.

00:56:05.642 --> 00:56:07.726
Appeared...

00:56:07.767 --> 00:56:09.851
The blueprint appeared...

00:56:12.851 --> 00:56:16.309
Yes, I need to imagine
the full blueprint.

00:56:16.934 --> 00:56:19.268
The full blueprint...

00:56:48.268 --> 00:56:51.101
So, which city should I build
for you on my island?

00:57:21.934 --> 00:57:24.977
They say you have a lot
of memories in your room.

00:57:25.852 --> 00:57:27.144
Well, yeah.

00:57:27.642 --> 00:57:29.726
I want to see them.
Will you show me?

00:57:35.810 --> 00:57:38.852
How many there are!
I've got almost none.

00:57:38.894 --> 00:57:41.143
Meaning you don't
remember anything at all?

00:57:41.185 --> 00:57:43.143
Only a feeling.

00:57:43.726 --> 00:57:45.726
Did you get into
a car accident?

00:57:45.769 --> 00:57:48.643
Yes, I was on my way
to an important meeting,

00:57:49.642 --> 00:57:52.185
but it turned out
to be a trap.

00:57:52.226 --> 00:57:53.935
An architect trap?

00:57:53.976 --> 00:57:56.101
Yeah, I agree,
it sounds crazy.

00:57:59.726 --> 00:58:01.684
And this woman?
Were you close?

00:58:01.726 --> 00:58:02.934
I don't remember,

00:58:02.977 --> 00:58:04.643
and it's not important
anymore. I...

00:58:04.685 --> 00:58:07.894
- My life is here now.
- But you wanted to wake up so much.

00:58:07.935 --> 00:58:11.144
Yes, yes, I know. But...

00:58:12.894 --> 00:58:16.935
I met you and I can
become myself here.

00:58:16.977 --> 00:58:18.769
I feel that Yan is right.

00:58:18.810 --> 00:58:22.769
If we don't remember anything,
we can start a life over.

00:58:25.852 --> 00:58:28.602
And become someone who
we've always wanted to be.

00:58:28.643 --> 00:58:31.185
- Sounds silly, right?
- No.

00:58:34.684 --> 00:58:36.768
I feel the same way.

00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:38.685
Then you remember
something.

00:58:41.226 --> 00:58:42.976
I do.

00:58:44.643 --> 00:58:47.310
I couldn't be with
the one I wanted.

00:58:49.768 --> 00:58:51.351
And here I can.

00:59:38.143 --> 00:59:39.352
During the mission,

00:59:39.392 --> 00:59:42.143
everyone should strictly
follow the leader.

00:59:42.685 --> 00:59:45.352
Don't deviate,
keep your distance.

00:59:45.392 --> 00:59:48.142
- Will we get guns?
- You don't need guns.

00:59:48.184 --> 00:59:51.142
There are no Reapers
on that route.

00:59:51.185 --> 00:59:53.893
This is where
we'll build an island.

00:59:53.934 --> 00:59:56.100
We will go through the hills.

00:59:56.810 --> 00:59:58.685
They won't even notice us.

00:59:58.726 --> 01:00:00.768
What if you missed
some of them?

01:00:01.018 --> 01:00:02.143
I know them all.

01:00:02.184 --> 01:00:04.809
I've considered each one.
Spirit?

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:08.060
Seems about right.
Usually I sense them...

01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:11.601
Phantom, listen.

01:00:11.643 --> 01:00:14.976
Should we take these
fuse wires for the explosives?

01:00:15.684 --> 01:00:17.142
Astronomer is leading
the squad.

01:00:17.184 --> 01:00:18.351
He's the commander now.

01:00:18.393 --> 01:00:20.019
Ok, got it.

01:01:43.143 --> 01:01:45.060
So, I've got a question.

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:48.352
What should I build
on this island?

01:01:48.894 --> 01:01:50.602
You're the architect,
so it's up to you.

01:01:50.643 --> 01:01:52.227
I do have one project,
but it's not mine,

01:01:52.268 --> 01:01:55.143
and the client would be
against me borrowing it.

01:01:55.769 --> 01:01:58.936
Oh, I think you can
tell him to go to hell now.

01:01:58.975 --> 01:02:01.267
- Well...
- I don't know what kind of project it is,

01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:04.644
but you, Architect,
should build me a custom hut.

01:02:04.684 --> 01:02:08.809
- With a garage, you know?
- And a hot tub for me!

01:02:08.852 --> 01:02:12.810
- A shooting range for me!
- Ok, guys, chill! Let's form a line!

01:02:15.352 --> 01:02:16.811
Reaper!

01:02:29.894 --> 01:02:30.685
That's impossible.

01:02:30.727 --> 01:02:33.811
I've checked everything!
Are you sure?

01:02:34.143 --> 01:02:36.601
- I say what I sense.
- Damn it.

01:02:36.643 --> 01:02:38.893
It's always like that
with the Reapers.

01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:43.893
We won't make it far with
all this ballast, if at all!

01:02:44.352 --> 01:02:46.268
Should we turn back?

01:02:48.310 --> 01:02:50.643
We won't get another chance
to get there any time soon,

01:02:50.685 --> 01:02:52.351
but it's up to you.

01:02:55.852 --> 01:02:57.310
Phantom.

01:02:57.727 --> 01:03:00.852
You've got more experience.
What do you think?

01:03:01.768 --> 01:03:03.810
We should split up,
check all directions,

01:03:03.851 --> 01:03:07.059
then return here
and choose a new route.

01:03:08.143 --> 01:03:09.143
Reasonable.

01:03:09.184 --> 01:03:12.142
Two of us should stay,
to protect the others.

01:03:12.185 --> 01:03:15.310
- Architect and I will stay.
- Architect won't be able to help you.

01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:18.309
He can't shoot,
has no experience.

01:03:18.351 --> 01:03:20.226
You better stay with Tank.

01:03:20.811 --> 01:03:22.811
- Or I'll stay if you like.
- No.

01:03:22.852 --> 01:03:24.352
Nothing will happen to him!

01:03:24.727 --> 01:03:26.727
We're just scouting,
but we have civilians here.

01:03:26.768 --> 01:03:27.975
No!

01:03:28.018 --> 01:03:30.851
I can do it.
It's ok.

01:03:32.685 --> 01:03:36.644
Tank stays here.
Architect, get to that hill.

01:03:36.684 --> 01:03:39.560
When you see a plane, come
back right away. Understood?

01:03:39.602 --> 01:03:41.101
The rest go in your
respective direction.

01:03:41.143 --> 01:03:42.727
Spread out!

01:05:14.101 --> 01:05:15.809
Tank, what are you
doing here?

01:05:16.602 --> 01:05:19.184
Yan sent me,
like he sensed it.

01:05:21.977 --> 01:05:23.017
Hurry!

01:05:34.726 --> 01:05:36.976
Reapers!
About a thousand feet!

01:05:37.018 --> 01:05:38.851
We need to leave!

01:05:43.142 --> 01:05:44.851
- What...
- Give me that!

01:05:44.892 --> 01:05:46.767
- What are you doing?
- I said give it to me!

01:05:48.601 --> 01:05:49.934
Let go of it!

01:05:51.892 --> 01:05:53.643
Let him go!

01:05:56.352 --> 01:05:58.227
Where did you get that?

01:05:58.976 --> 01:06:01.892
- You planted it!
- You set us all up!

01:06:06.226 --> 01:06:09.602
I didn't mean to.
We need to leave.

01:06:10.893 --> 01:06:12.602
Hey! Wait!

01:06:14.017 --> 01:06:15.725
It's not what you think.

01:06:15.767 --> 01:06:19.101
You don't know everything.

01:06:19.143 --> 01:06:21.269
It's... He's the one who...

01:06:31.851 --> 01:06:35.725
We need to leave.
We all need to leave right now.

01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:37.726
Reapers!

01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:42.060
Astronomer!
Lead everyone away!

01:06:43.352 --> 01:06:47.269
Listen up everyone!
Get rid of the heavy gear!

01:06:52.142 --> 01:06:52.976
Cable!

01:06:57.309 --> 01:06:58.767
On your right!

01:07:19.226 --> 01:07:20.309
Architect, to the bus!
Hurry!

01:07:20.352 --> 01:07:22.226
Astronomer,
take him with you!

01:08:06.725 --> 01:08:07.977
Hey.

01:08:10.226 --> 01:08:11.977
Hey!

01:08:12.352 --> 01:08:14.144
Hey!

01:08:14.893 --> 01:08:16.352
Hey!

01:08:29.184 --> 01:08:31.851
- They responded to the Reaper whistle.
- Behind you!

01:08:32.893 --> 01:08:34.601
This is it, guys.

01:08:35.352 --> 01:08:36.935
There!

01:08:46.269 --> 01:08:48.018
Architect!

01:10:14.393 --> 01:10:16.226
We're almost there.

01:10:16.269 --> 01:10:18.685
- Were you given an advance payment?
- What advance payment?

01:10:18.726 --> 01:10:19.726
Don't you see?

01:10:19.768 --> 01:10:22.059
Unlike other idiots,
they accepted me

01:10:22.102 --> 01:10:23.560
and my projects!

01:10:23.601 --> 01:10:26.102
Yeah, right.
They told you how cool you are,

01:10:26.143 --> 01:10:27.767
how great your projects
are and that's it?

01:10:27.810 --> 01:10:28.935
Have you lost your mind?

01:10:28.976 --> 01:10:30.268
Do you watch TV?

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:32.684
Do you have any idea what
they say about your clients?

01:10:32.726 --> 01:10:36.143
They are using you.
They won't pay you.

01:10:36.185 --> 01:10:38.226
Or even worse,
I don't know.

01:10:38.269 --> 01:10:41.060
There is a way out.

01:10:42.185 --> 01:10:44.852
The Teacher loves you.

01:10:45.102 --> 01:10:46.935
Save us!

01:10:47.934 --> 01:10:49.600
Follow his calling.

01:10:49.642 --> 01:10:52.184
- Read what the Teacher says about you!
- Damn!

01:10:52.226 --> 01:10:54.393
A path to a new life
will open up for you!

01:10:55.144 --> 01:10:56.977
A new life awaits.

01:10:57.018 --> 01:11:00.101
Read what the Teacher
says about you.

01:11:02.102 --> 01:11:03.810
He will set you free.

01:11:05.185 --> 01:11:07.144
- Is that him?
- I don't know.

01:11:07.685 --> 01:11:08.601
You don't know
what he looks like?

01:11:08.642 --> 01:11:10.310
We just talked online,
that's it.

01:11:10.352 --> 01:11:11.642
Zip it!

01:11:13.351 --> 01:11:15.310
We were told
you'd be alone.

01:11:15.352 --> 01:11:17.935
- But he's not alone!
- Calm down.

01:11:17.976 --> 01:11:20.184
We can only let
you in alone.

01:11:20.227 --> 01:11:22.185
My apologies,
we have very strict rules.

01:11:22.726 --> 01:11:25.726
- Are you the client?
- Oh no, of course not.

01:11:25.767 --> 01:11:28.227
I'm just a simple assistant.

01:11:29.726 --> 01:11:32.143
It was me who sent
you the proposal mail.

01:11:32.393 --> 01:11:34.768
The Teacher is
awaiting you inside.

01:11:35.643 --> 01:11:39.018
- You aren't going to...
- I beg you, please wait for me here.

01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:40.685
- Hold on.
- What?

01:11:40.726 --> 01:11:42.352
Here, take it.

01:11:52.311 --> 01:11:54.727
What is it?
A hospital?

01:11:54.768 --> 01:11:57.810
Used to be.
We just took it over.

01:12:29.684 --> 01:12:32.642
Genius. How long have
you had this idea?

01:12:32.685 --> 01:12:34.643
Since university.

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:37.894
And people continue
building these ugly boxes.

01:12:37.935 --> 01:12:40.102
Yes, you're absolutely right,
it's crazy.

01:12:40.143 --> 01:12:42.934
I've sent them to many places.
To different competitions etc...

01:12:42.976 --> 01:12:46.101
Pointless. It's pointless
to cast pearls before swine.

01:12:46.143 --> 01:12:49.935
This world will never
recognize something unique,

01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:53.144
even if it's 100 times better.

01:12:53.392 --> 01:12:56.350
Would you really be able
to build what I propose?

01:12:58.685 --> 01:13:00.643
Follow me,
I'll show you something.

01:13:08.976 --> 01:13:13.767
Pardon me, what exactly
does your organization do?

01:13:15.227 --> 01:13:18.144
You know,
there are many rumors.

01:13:19.643 --> 01:13:21.602
We give people an
enlightened new life.

01:13:21.642 --> 01:13:23.309
You can see it on the billboard.

01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:28.144
You'll see it for yourself.

01:13:38.767 --> 01:13:40.851
While studying the cerebral
physiology of the brain,

01:13:40.894 --> 01:13:43.602
I discovered that in a state
of a deep coma,

01:13:43.642 --> 01:13:47.143
one has access to a whole world
that no one else knows about.

01:13:47.186 --> 01:13:50.977
This world is much better
than the common reality.

01:13:51.727 --> 01:13:53.351
Do you mean dreams?

01:13:53.851 --> 01:13:56.143
It's impossible to explain.
Would you like to take a look?

01:13:56.186 --> 01:13:58.350
I'm in a hurry,
I've got things to do.

01:13:58.393 --> 01:14:00.351
It won't take long.

01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:03.101
I'm sure you'll like it!

01:14:05.768 --> 01:14:07.726
Get off!
Stay away!

01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:25.810
- What happened?
- Come on! Go! Go! Go!

01:14:27.768 --> 01:14:29.643
I just ran a person over!

01:14:29.685 --> 01:14:32.226
- Drive! Drive! Drive!
- I told you they were lying!

01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:35.225
Why don't you listen to me!
Why can't you ever listen to me!

01:15:13.685 --> 01:15:18.810
She was put in a coma just
a couple of hours before you.

01:15:19.268 --> 01:15:21.643
But there,
months have passed.

01:15:21.685 --> 01:15:23.350
Extraordinary, isn't it?

01:15:23.851 --> 01:15:25.809
Who the hell are you?

01:15:26.392 --> 01:15:31.060
A group of scientists who want
to gift people a new world.

01:15:32.019 --> 01:15:34.184
And the spiritual teachings?

01:15:34.684 --> 01:15:37.268
To help to finance
the project.

01:15:37.309 --> 01:15:41.309
My studies were deemed a
failure, so I had to find a way.

01:15:41.351 --> 01:15:42.977
As a wise man said,

01:15:43.018 --> 01:15:46.852
"If you want to get rich,
create your own religion."

01:15:46.894 --> 01:15:50.977
You know, by the way, it was
much easier than I thought.

01:15:51.019 --> 01:15:54.643
- So my city project is a lie?
- Of course not!

01:15:55.934 --> 01:15:57.642
The city is real.

01:15:58.185 --> 01:16:01.643
I've formed a team of people

01:16:01.685 --> 01:16:04.643
with specific brain pathologies,

01:16:04.684 --> 01:16:06.810
so they could survive
in a coma.

01:16:06.851 --> 01:16:10.810
I found an artist with an
amazing memory and imagination,

01:16:10.852 --> 01:16:15.185
so he could work on a worthy
project and realize it there.

01:16:15.226 --> 01:16:16.685
What for?

01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:20.018
Don't you get it?
To live there.

01:16:20.267 --> 01:16:21.934
In dreams?

01:16:23.352 --> 01:16:27.019
The coma world was known
to people long before us.

01:16:27.727 --> 01:16:32.643
Ancient rulers of many
cultures went there.

01:16:32.684 --> 01:16:34.810
But modern technology
plastered it

01:16:34.851 --> 01:16:38.726
with walking corpses
of Reapers.

01:16:38.769 --> 01:16:41.727
And all these people found a
new meaning there, a new life.

01:16:41.768 --> 01:16:44.019
Even you were
almost happy there.

01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:46.310
There, you are
the great architect.

01:16:46.351 --> 01:16:48.643
And what awaits you here?

01:16:48.934 --> 01:16:51.018
Custom cottages.

01:16:51.392 --> 01:16:53.643
If you're lucky.

01:16:54.936 --> 01:16:57.185
Did they get the
same injection as me?

01:16:57.225 --> 01:16:59.351
It's faster
and better for them.

01:16:59.392 --> 01:17:01.393
Maybe you should have
asked them first!

01:17:04.351 --> 01:17:07.643
You know, Phantom's memory
was fully recovered.

01:17:08.226 --> 01:17:10.685
He remembered
how he got here

01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:12.977
and who he was.

01:17:14.225 --> 01:17:16.976
But he didn't want
to wake up.

01:17:17.018 --> 01:17:19.019
Later a Reaper got to him.

01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:22.268
On a physiological level
it's a necrosis of brain tissue.

01:17:22.851 --> 01:17:24.018
He panicked,

01:17:24.059 --> 01:17:26.685
started to threaten us that
he would reveal the truth.

01:17:26.727 --> 01:17:27.936
In the end he killed
a bunch of people

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:29.352
and almost screwed up
everything.

01:17:29.393 --> 01:17:31.894
It took some effort
to get you out of there.

01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:35.852
So the more you know, really,
the more problems arise.

01:17:38.227 --> 01:17:40.310
And... all of your followers,

01:17:40.351 --> 01:17:42.352
will you take them
with you to Coma?

01:17:42.393 --> 01:17:44.185
We need them to
create a mode of life.

01:17:44.226 --> 01:17:45.935
Slaves.

01:17:45.976 --> 01:17:49.644
But they don't know that they
will be put into a coma, right?

01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:53.100
In return I give people an
infinite life full of meaning.

01:17:53.142 --> 01:17:54.267
What's wrong with that?

01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:56.727
Everyone gets what
they want in Coma.

01:17:56.768 --> 01:17:59.851
One person is a commander
or spiritual leader,

01:17:59.894 --> 01:18:02.352
another person
is a great architect.

01:18:02.392 --> 01:18:04.184
You are crazy!

01:18:04.226 --> 01:18:05.936
Don't you understand
these are just dreams?

01:18:05.977 --> 01:18:07.852
It doesn't matter.
Look...

01:18:07.894 --> 01:18:08.810
That's it,
I'm out of here.

01:18:08.851 --> 01:18:11.351
Just let us go, please,
that's all.

01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:17.894
Knowledge is the source
of all problems.

01:18:21.685 --> 01:18:24.185
You will still accomplish
what is required.

01:18:24.227 --> 01:18:26.727
I won't go back
there anymore.

01:18:29.226 --> 01:18:32.267
You know,
when a Reaper gets a person,

01:18:33.017 --> 01:18:36.893
their brain dies
in a couple of minutes.

01:18:37.142 --> 01:18:39.143
Did you leave her
in a field?

01:18:39.185 --> 01:18:41.352
Hmm, strange.
For now...

01:18:41.393 --> 01:18:42.685
For now it seems normal.

01:18:42.727 --> 01:18:44.685
But it's impossible to see
everything--

01:18:44.726 --> 01:18:46.101
Enough!

01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:49.060
Let her go!
She's not a part of this!

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:50.017
I invited you alone.

01:18:50.059 --> 01:18:52.185
You started the race
and crashed.

01:18:52.226 --> 01:18:55.185
You did this to yourself,
and to her.

01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:58.810
Either way, you're building the
island and your city on it.

01:18:58.852 --> 01:19:00.976
Then I will let you both go.

01:19:01.017 --> 01:19:03.059
You will let all of us go!

01:19:06.268 --> 01:19:09.727
I give you my word,
I won't hold anyone back.

01:19:29.934 --> 01:19:32.226
You will wake up
in your home again.

01:19:33.059 --> 01:19:36.726
The brain is drawn to
the strongest memories.

01:19:37.975 --> 01:19:40.726
This time, your memory
will recover much faster.

01:19:41.017 --> 01:19:43.018
You will find Astronomer.

01:19:43.059 --> 01:19:45.560
The coordinates for building
the city are on his map.

01:19:45.601 --> 01:19:47.352
What if I don't make it?

01:19:47.393 --> 01:19:49.227
You will.

01:19:49.267 --> 01:19:53.934
This stimulant will make
your brain work more intensely.

01:19:54.851 --> 01:19:56.643
Sure, it will
damage your health,

01:19:57.227 --> 01:19:59.685
but you'll be like
Superman for a while.

01:20:00.059 --> 01:20:03.392
Wait, how will they know when
it's time to get out of Coma?

01:20:03.685 --> 01:20:04.975
They won't.

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:09.226
Well, there is a way.
From within.

01:20:09.893 --> 01:20:11.893
A back door of sorts.

01:20:11.935 --> 01:20:14.685
I'll show you once you've
accomplished everything.

01:20:14.727 --> 01:20:17.726
Think about it.
I was able to leave.

01:20:18.352 --> 01:20:19.935
Sleep.

01:21:39.309 --> 01:21:40.850
Get down!

01:21:48.727 --> 01:21:51.726
That's it.
That's the last one.

01:21:51.768 --> 01:21:53.851
Leave it with us.

01:22:20.102 --> 01:22:21.892
Yeah...

01:22:24.309 --> 01:22:26.601
It's not what you think.

01:22:29.686 --> 01:22:31.644
We need to leave.

01:22:31.685 --> 01:22:33.268
Hurry.

01:22:43.268 --> 01:22:45.725
A lot of people resist it
in the beginning.

01:22:45.768 --> 01:22:48.060
Maybe you should
give him some more time.

01:22:49.977 --> 01:22:51.643
No.

01:22:53.017 --> 01:22:55.018
Do as I say.

01:23:14.352 --> 01:23:16.227
Here it is.

01:23:17.102 --> 01:23:19.310
Yan chose this place himself.

01:23:19.351 --> 01:23:23.226
He said it was majestic.

01:23:26.102 --> 01:23:27.602
What's wrong?

01:23:27.643 --> 01:23:29.226
Are you hurt?

01:23:29.269 --> 01:23:32.393
It's nothing.
I'm just tired.

01:23:34.143 --> 01:23:36.602
I will live on this island
for some time.

01:23:37.142 --> 01:23:39.102
Soon...

01:23:40.602 --> 01:23:42.269
I can't believe it.

01:23:43.850 --> 01:23:45.309
Yan was right after all.

01:23:45.352 --> 01:23:47.018
Don't you get it?

01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:49.977
We are all laying
in that lunatic's basement.

01:23:50.017 --> 01:23:52.934
There will be no island!
It's just a dream!

01:23:55.601 --> 01:23:57.560
I know it's hard
to comprehend,

01:23:57.602 --> 01:23:58.810
but when you see it
with your own eyes,

01:23:58.851 --> 01:24:00.809
how you're laying there...

01:24:00.851 --> 01:24:03.184
So you told them after all.

01:24:03.935 --> 01:24:05.852
They've been through
so much already.

01:24:05.893 --> 01:24:08.018
It's not very fair.

01:24:09.269 --> 01:24:11.102
Where do you want it?

01:24:12.767 --> 01:24:16.102
The bridge should
start right here.

01:25:26.226 --> 01:25:28.726
"God saw all
that he had made,

01:25:28.767 --> 01:25:31.018
and it was very good."

01:26:30.642 --> 01:26:33.184
What do you need reality
for after this?

01:26:38.227 --> 01:26:40.810
Yan, I've built everything.
Let us go.

01:26:48.309 --> 01:26:49.935
Spirit.

01:26:50.893 --> 01:26:54.310
In life you saw dead people
all around you...

01:26:55.269 --> 01:26:58.352
...and had seizures
a couple of times a day.

01:26:58.810 --> 01:27:02.310
You don't have any relatives,
and you lost your only child.

01:27:02.810 --> 01:27:04.226
I saved you from the asylum,

01:27:04.269 --> 01:27:07.893
where you would have rotted
till your dying day.

01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:10.102
Tank.

01:27:10.143 --> 01:27:12.893
You lost your family
in an accident.

01:27:13.684 --> 01:27:15.226
Became a raging alcoholic.

01:27:15.268 --> 01:27:17.768
Started shooting
at your neighbors.

01:27:17.809 --> 01:27:22.726
You would have ended up
in a madhouse or a jail.

01:27:23.727 --> 01:27:26.060
Astronomer, you're autistic.

01:27:26.101 --> 01:27:28.143
You can't even leave
your house.

01:27:28.184 --> 01:27:31.310
Your poor old folks.

01:27:31.684 --> 01:27:34.643
What will happen
when they die, huh?

01:27:35.727 --> 01:27:39.768
And you have a more serious
issue, Architect.

01:27:41.311 --> 01:27:44.977
Your ideas are beautiful,
but way ahead of their time,

01:27:45.018 --> 01:27:46.184
so no one wants them.

01:27:46.227 --> 01:27:48.643
Everyone has abandoned you,
including her,

01:27:48.684 --> 01:27:50.143
who was by your side
till the very end.

01:27:50.184 --> 01:27:52.226
He is nothing out there.

01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:54.934
An infantile,
unrecognized genius

01:27:54.977 --> 01:27:57.768
who lets all his anger
out on you,

01:27:57.809 --> 01:27:59.976
on the whole world.

01:28:01.684 --> 01:28:06.143
I bet you contemplated suicide
long before you got that email.

01:28:09.185 --> 01:28:13.227
This project gave
new meaning to your life.

01:28:20.101 --> 01:28:22.601
- Were you given an advance payment?
- What advance?

01:28:22.642 --> 01:28:23.976
Don't you see?

01:28:24.019 --> 01:28:25.977
Unlike other idiots,
they accepted me

01:28:26.018 --> 01:28:27.809
and my projects!

01:28:28.893 --> 01:28:30.144
Keep laughing.

01:28:30.184 --> 01:28:31.976
Everything will change for us
after this, I know it.

01:28:32.019 --> 01:28:35.602
For us?
There is no "us".

01:28:35.642 --> 01:28:37.602
That's why you're
sitting in this car.

01:28:37.643 --> 01:28:38.809
Jesus!

01:28:39.977 --> 01:28:41.643
They told you
how cool you are,

01:28:41.685 --> 01:28:43.977
how great your projects are,
and that's it?

01:28:44.018 --> 01:28:47.227
- Have you lost your mind?
- You used to believe in me.

01:28:47.269 --> 01:28:50.768
They are using you,
they won't pay you.

01:28:50.809 --> 01:28:54.310
- Or even worse, I don't know.
- Got a guilty conscience?

01:28:54.767 --> 01:28:57.311
This is a great car.
I'm sure it was a gift,

01:28:57.351 --> 01:29:00.810
considering you're just a nurse.
But that's ok.

01:29:00.852 --> 01:29:03.851
I'll buy you a new one
when I'm famous.

01:29:05.684 --> 01:29:07.851
This is the last time
I'm helping you.

01:29:13.894 --> 01:29:15.977
We're staying.

01:29:16.851 --> 01:29:18.350
Stay.

01:29:28.351 --> 01:29:31.852
But now
I won't let you stay.

01:29:37.767 --> 01:29:40.392
I can't.
You would reveal everything.

01:29:44.768 --> 01:29:47.935
- And who's going to believe us?
- My followers.

01:29:47.976 --> 01:29:50.976
You can't hide it forever.
And in heaven,

01:29:51.018 --> 01:29:55.143
there is no place for those who
know the secret of its creation.

01:29:55.810 --> 01:29:57.768
It concerns you as well.

01:29:57.809 --> 01:29:59.726
Now that you know everything,

01:29:59.767 --> 01:30:01.851
I can't let you live
among the others.

01:30:01.894 --> 01:30:04.186
We won't tell anyone.

01:30:05.851 --> 01:30:07.642
It's done.

01:30:12.643 --> 01:30:14.144
You are suffocating there.

01:30:14.186 --> 01:30:17.894
Brain oxygen
starvation has started

01:30:18.227 --> 01:30:20.810
and you will feel it soon.

01:30:27.351 --> 01:30:30.144
I don't know in which order
you were switched off.

01:30:30.185 --> 01:30:31.059
There, it's a matter
of seconds,

01:30:31.102 --> 01:30:33.976
but here we've got
about fifteen minutes

01:30:34.019 --> 01:30:35.852
to say our goodbyes.

01:30:41.101 --> 01:30:41.809
Stop!

01:30:47.852 --> 01:30:50.018
I was prepared for this.

01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:51.852
Brain stimulation
can be harmful,

01:30:51.894 --> 01:30:54.935
but I thought it wouldn't
hurt in this situation.

01:30:55.976 --> 01:30:57.977
I have business to attend to.

01:31:20.851 --> 01:31:22.768
Damn it!

01:31:22.809 --> 01:31:25.185
You warned me that
they would fuck me over.

01:31:26.061 --> 01:31:28.185
- What?
- We need to wake up.

01:31:29.935 --> 01:31:32.184
We will wake up
and switch him off.

01:31:32.225 --> 01:31:33.768
The back door!

01:31:34.102 --> 01:31:35.393
Astronomer!

01:31:37.267 --> 01:31:39.726
How did he escape
when the Reapers attacked?

01:31:39.769 --> 01:31:41.101
Dreams.

01:31:41.144 --> 01:31:44.185
All of us are dreaming
where we are laying right now.

01:31:44.225 --> 01:31:46.351
If you can find yourself
in that dream, then...

01:31:46.392 --> 01:31:49.684
That's why he said that
dreams are dangerous!

01:31:49.727 --> 01:31:51.061
- They are dangerous.
- Let's go!

01:31:51.102 --> 01:31:53.185
- It's not that easy!
- We don't have much time, Astronomer!

01:31:53.225 --> 01:31:54.684
Spirit, let's go!

01:32:50.935 --> 01:32:52.019
Come on.

01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:54.018
Astronomer, we need
to get to Yan's room. Hurry!

01:32:55.351 --> 01:32:57.060
They are already there.

01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:06.893
- We won't make it!
- Shit!

01:33:11.226 --> 01:33:12.769
I've got an idea.

01:33:29.142 --> 01:33:30.769
Come on!
Hurry!

01:34:53.352 --> 01:34:56.685
- What?
- It's not how I remember it.

01:34:56.726 --> 01:34:59.142
These are dreams,
I told you.

01:34:59.936 --> 01:35:01.268
We need to try harder
to find that place.

01:35:01.309 --> 01:35:03.100
Everything is mixed up here.

01:35:04.935 --> 01:35:06.809
Then there, I think.

01:36:13.227 --> 01:36:16.726
There was a door and stairs.
It's not the same!

01:36:17.976 --> 01:36:19.142
Astronomer?

01:36:19.768 --> 01:36:22.309
Everything is linked
by association in here.

01:36:22.810 --> 01:36:25.185
Try not to search according
to the blueprint of the rooms.

01:36:26.268 --> 01:36:27.644
How?

01:36:28.185 --> 01:36:29.769
Details!

01:36:29.810 --> 01:36:33.267
Search for a detail that
reminds you of that room.

01:36:33.851 --> 01:36:35.227
A detail...

01:36:53.684 --> 01:36:55.267
Yes, here it is.

01:36:56.185 --> 01:36:59.143
It was in a painting
in that room!

01:36:59.393 --> 01:37:00.893
Right.

01:37:01.810 --> 01:37:03.351
I was right.

01:37:09.226 --> 01:37:11.142
Of course you're right.

01:37:12.684 --> 01:37:14.226
Astronomer is a genius
after all.

01:37:14.267 --> 01:37:16.102
Where would we be
without him?

01:37:16.143 --> 01:37:19.394
Our memory retains the things
we find most interesting.

01:37:20.143 --> 01:37:20.934
And of all things,

01:37:20.976 --> 01:37:23.769
you remembered a temple
in a painting.

01:37:25.102 --> 01:37:26.935
A true architect.

01:37:28.184 --> 01:37:31.769
You know, I really hoped
you'd be smarter than the rest.

01:37:33.143 --> 01:37:35.851
You reminded me of myself
when I was young.

01:37:39.643 --> 01:37:41.309
Medicine fights to prolong
a human's life

01:37:41.351 --> 01:37:42.768
for five more years.

01:37:43.268 --> 01:37:45.686
But I was able to
prolong it for a thousand.

01:37:45.726 --> 01:37:47.267
And you know what?

01:37:47.602 --> 01:37:49.727
My department was closed,

01:37:49.769 --> 01:37:54.017
to finance the development
of a new anti-cellulite product.

01:37:54.934 --> 01:37:57.934
And I never understood how to
live in a world so foolish,

01:37:57.976 --> 01:37:58.935
so ugly.

01:37:58.975 --> 01:38:02.267
But then I realized
there is another world.

01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:04.352
I discovered it.

01:38:10.309 --> 01:38:11.768
Fly, run!

01:38:15.102 --> 01:38:17.102
But just like you,
I had my doubts.

01:38:17.143 --> 01:38:19.309
It's just an illusion
after all.

01:38:19.935 --> 01:38:22.394
I thought so,
until I made a discovery.

01:38:23.268 --> 01:38:26.602
Everything that we live for,
all of our emotions--

01:38:26.644 --> 01:38:30.977
joy, happiness, anger,
astonishment, sadness--

01:38:31.018 --> 01:38:34.602
they are all simply
electrical signals of our brain.

01:38:35.850 --> 01:38:37.935
We measured them on people
in a coma and in real life,

01:38:37.976 --> 01:38:39.977
and you know what?

01:38:40.018 --> 01:38:42.767
They are absolutely identical.

01:38:43.934 --> 01:38:46.934
Life in Coma
is as real as it gets.

01:38:49.685 --> 01:38:52.017
That's it.
It's as simple as that.

01:40:51.726 --> 01:40:53.768
We found it, Fly.

01:42:00.226 --> 01:42:01.352
Come on.

01:42:02.017 --> 01:42:03.309
Come on.

01:42:03.351 --> 01:42:04.851
Quiet.

01:42:08.976 --> 01:42:10.852
Quiet.

01:42:11.685 --> 01:42:14.684
Breath.
Breath.

01:42:15.685 --> 01:42:18.768
Breath. Quiet.

01:42:40.394 --> 01:42:41.809
What...

01:43:01.726 --> 01:43:03.309
We're going home.

01:43:03.351 --> 01:43:04.810
Everything is going
to be alright.

01:43:04.852 --> 01:43:06.852
We're going home.

01:43:07.101 --> 01:43:09.726
We're going.
Stand up.

01:44:19.144 --> 01:44:22.810
Well, I'm almost done,
but I need a break.

01:44:22.851 --> 01:44:26.810
- Let's take Torik out for a walk.
- Alright, let's go.

01:44:26.851 --> 01:44:30.143
What about your projects?
Did anyone reply?

01:44:30.185 --> 01:44:31.394
No.

01:44:32.768 --> 01:44:35.185
Maybe that's down
to the presentation.

01:44:35.226 --> 01:44:38.184
No, everything is fine.
You just have to be realistic.

01:44:38.227 --> 01:44:39.977
My projects are worthless.

01:44:40.019 --> 01:44:43.810
But at least this year
will be better financially.

01:44:43.851 --> 01:44:45.727
We won the contract.

01:44:46.059 --> 01:44:48.101
- Are you kidding?
- No.

01:44:49.643 --> 01:44:51.184
Congratulations.

01:44:51.227 --> 01:44:53.060
It looks like
the scandal involving

01:44:53.101 --> 01:44:54.310
the Foundation
of Eternal Life

01:44:54.351 --> 01:44:56.352
will end without a result,
after all.

01:44:56.685 --> 01:45:01.018
All charges will be dropped
due to a lack of evidence,

01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:05.352
as it was established that
all subjects of the experiment

01:45:05.392 --> 01:45:07.019
were there legally.

01:45:07.060 --> 01:45:09.977
The organization continues
to successfully

01:45:10.018 --> 01:45:11.393
recruit followers...

01:45:23.976 --> 01:45:26.018
Do you think they
will come for us?

01:45:26.059 --> 01:45:27.184
We have nothing
to be afraid of.

01:45:27.227 --> 01:45:28.642
Get dressed.

01:45:43.934 --> 01:45:45.726
By the way,
the mail came this morning.

01:45:45.767 --> 01:45:47.101
There was an envelope
for you.

01:45:47.144 --> 01:45:49.059
- Yeah, I saw it already.
- What was in it?

01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:55.935
Nothing special.

01:45:55.976 --> 01:45:59.018
Just some documents
for an old project.
