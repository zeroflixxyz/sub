00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.710
Ma.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.240
It's usually the
first word we speak.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.070
A word that's
impossible to define...

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.630
Because no other
words can do it justice.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:12.820
Mothers are considered
greater than God.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.470
They're synonymous with sacrifice.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.600
But my mother isn't like that.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.150
Today, I'm doing what perhaps
no daughter has done before.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.500
I'm filing a criminal
case against my mother.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.770
There she is.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.960
Ms. Anupama Banerji...

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.740
Ms. Shakuntala Devi's daughter.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.920
This is Mr Graham, the mediator.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.190
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.180
You okay?

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.600
So, Ms. Banerji, you have
accused Ms. Shakuntala Devi

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.920
of illegally trying to destroy
your financial standing.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.480
She is your mother, and a
world-famous mathematician.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.250
Are world-famous
mathematicians above the law?

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.370
This could lead to
a jail sentence for her.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.350
Are you absolutely
certain you want to do this?

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.360
Yes.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.000
Yes, I am.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.730
My mother tore me away
from every person I ever loved.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.410
But not anymore.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.320
Even if it means going to war...

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.950
Against the 'great' Shakuntala Devi.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.680
16777216...

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.100
So the first set is 216...

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.350
Then 716.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.830
2 x 2 = 4

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.370
4 x 2 = 8

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.410
256?

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.090
- What did you say?
- Your cube root.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.000
This?

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.830
This is an eight digit number.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.700
And you're five years old!

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.760
Shakuntala!

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.170
How did you do it?

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.470
It just comes to me naturally!

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.390
Liar!

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.700
I'm not a liar!

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.650
Then explain how you did it!

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.440
I can't explain it.
I can only show you.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.130
Can you only do cube roots,
or is there more up your sleeve?

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.060
Give me sweets and I'll tell you!

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.170
Forget sweets. I'll give you money.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.940
You can buy anything with it.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.940
Anything?

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.840
Yes!

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.630
Solve this.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.180
Uncle! Aunty!

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.300
Look what Shakuntala did!

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.580
Oh Lord. What did she do now?

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.830
I was studying.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.620
I was calculating the
cube root of an 8 digit number...

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.820
And she gave the answer in a flash!

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.580
It must have been a fluke...

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.890
No, really! See for yourself.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.560
Solve this.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.020
I won't do it for free!
Pay up.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.520
Okay, take this.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.030
And for the other one?

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.880
She's more mercenary
than the British empire!

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.540
Here. Solve it now.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.000
512, which is also the cube of 8.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.300
Now can I go buy my sweets?

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.510
Uncle, she's no ordinary girl.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.090
She's a genius!

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.600
Genie what?

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.970
Ge-ni-us.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.690
A brilliant mind
that's one in a million.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.920
Shakuntala, you're late for school!

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.180
Shakuntala, you're late for school!

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.190
Shaku, you're late for school!

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.150
There she comes.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.600
This tiny girl - she's
your mathematical genius?

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.180
So who's going to give
me math problems to solve?

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.120
Teachers can ask too.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.620
Just a request.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.190
Ask difficult questions...

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.480
Or she'll get bored.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.870
So, Math genius...

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.650
I hope this question won't bore you?

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.610
What are you doing?

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.470
They come in my way.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:29.650
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:33.990
Come on.

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.010
Shakuntala!

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:42.670
Father, I want to go to school too.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.430
We are going, right?

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.600
3 pm, Naivediyam Public School.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.630
Father, not for Maths shows.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.510
To study like other kids.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.630
What can a school teach you?

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.720
You'll end up teaching them.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.430
Come, let's go.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.540
Shakuntala, you need to practice.
Get inside.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.450
I want to play with Sharda.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.890
You're booked for
ten shows next week.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.380
Why must you make your father angry?

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.780
Unlike you, I'm not scared of him!

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.700
Is that how you talk
about your father?

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.370
He isn't my father. I'm his father!

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.640
What are you saying?

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.660
What do fathers in other homes do?

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.920
They work, earn money
and run the household.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.720
So who's the father
in this house then?

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.910
Shakuntala!

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:41.550
Yes, I'll get her.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.960
Come along.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:44.660
I won't.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:45.770
Come on!

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.040
What goes around comes around.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.480
Wait till your daughter
gives you a hard time!

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.960
Shaku, you aren't
afraid of anyone, right?

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.000
Mark my words.
You'll be a big man someday.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.270
Why would I be a man?

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.610
Because there's no such
thing as a 'big woman'!

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.510
In that case,
I'll definitely be a big woman.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.860
And you'll always be by my side!

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.370
"God-Promise"?

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:13.220
God-Promise!

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.640
Sharda!

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.500
Sharda!

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.250
Sharda, wake up!

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.690
Why didn't you take
Sharda to the hospital?

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:03.850
It would have cost a lot of money.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.910
I do shows day and night.
Where did all the money go?

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:17.090
If we try to save the dying, we'll
have nothing left for the living.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.220
Mother, I'm talking to you!

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.420
Have you lost your voice?

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.650
Why can't you speak
up in front of Father?

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:27.260
Shakuntala!

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.790
I'll never forgive
our mother, Sharda.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.160
I promise you - one day,
I'll be a very big woman.

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:41.890
And I won't be like our mother ever.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.970
God-promise.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.090
Miss Shakuntala!

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.620
Here's your money for today's
performance. In advance.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.310
Thanks.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.220
You can leave now.

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:04.680
No, I'll stay.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.020
No, carry on.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:09.210
Take a rickshaw.
And buy vegetables on the way.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.000
Don't be too late.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:27.880
Hello.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.200
Myself Shakuntala.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.090
Who is having first question for me?

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.610
Arun, ask her a question!

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:37.810
No, you guys go ahead.

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.710
You cleared your CA exam
in three months, man! Shoot!

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:43.940
- No man...
- Come on!

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:47.520
Myself Arun.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.980
Hello Arun. So what's your question?

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.060
I've been offered a
job at a British Company.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:56.280
Congrats!

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.600
The joining date is in April.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.460
I see.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:02.540
But I can't decide whether
I should accept the job or not.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.510
Why?

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.050
Well, their salary
structure is a bit strange.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:08.830
On the first day,
they'll pay me one paisa.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.220
On the second day, two paisas.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:11.760
On the third day, four paisas.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.610
And on the fourth day, eight paisas.

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.900
Basically, the pay
will be doubled every day.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.390
What do you think...

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.430
Should I take up the job?

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.560
I don't know if you
listened carefully...

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:31.760
But Arun said he's
required to join in April...

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.810
And April has 30 days.

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:36.030
Wow, ma'am! You really are a genius.

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:37.780
You know that April has 30 days!

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.020
A round of applause for the lady!

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:46.120
Arun, since you're
joining a British Company

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.740
should I give you the
answer in Pounds or Rupees?

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.820
Rupees will do, I guess.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:52.710
Okay.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:54.720
So your salary would be...

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.540
I am correct?

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.540
Arun, is she right?

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.000
She is!

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:10.920
So Arun, which company is this?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.690
Can ladies apply too?

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:39.080
They looked like
they had seen a ghost.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.550
Is it so weird to see
a woman solve math problems?

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:46.840
Well, women here usually only
solve household problems. Right?

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.170
That requires Maths too!

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.500
No one can win against you, my love!

00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:59.000
Did you tell your mother about us?

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:04.940
My love, we're going to
Alam's estate to hunt pheasants.

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:07.530
I'll talk to her
as soon as we're back.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.090
I've been hearing
this for a year now.

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:12.440
"I'll tell her after my
sister's engagement..."

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.450
"After my grandmother's
death anniversary..."

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:16.760
"As soon as my father's
back from Madras..."

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.330
It's getting late. Let me
drop you home. Okay?

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.580
I'll be right back
with the car keys...

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.160
My love.

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.860
Ms. Sukanya Gowthami
weds Mr. Dheeraj Murthy

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.220
Congratulations.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.610
My love, marriage in India
is like a deal fixed by our parents.

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:17.260
My love, nothing's
going to change between us!

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.690
Firstly, stop this 'my
love' nonsense of yours!

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:22.500
Shakuntala...

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:27.420
My father went ahead and fixed
me a match from within our caste.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.170
They're a family
of money and repute.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:30.900
I make money too, Dheeraj.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.100
Exactly! You're very independent.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.930
I come from an ordinary family,
Shakuntala...

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:40.480
And you aren't ordinary in any way.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.270
Yeah Dheeraj, I'm not ordinary.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:47.190
You know what an ordinary
girl would do in my place?

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.220
My love!

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.400
Lady! Care for some flowers?

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:28.860
Come...

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.830
This is Shakuntala Devi,
from Bangalore.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.680
Hello.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:36.710
Please sit.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:38.920
Would you like some pilaf?

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:40.410
Just tea, please.

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:41.180
Okay.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.730
Crumbling outside, bustling inside.

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:52.380
Welcome to Tarabai's guesthouse!

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:53.550
Thank you.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.360
Ms. Shakuntala, don't mind...

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.520
But we've never seen
any single ladies here before.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.570
Why?

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.170
What about me?

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.350
She's come here to build her future,
just like you.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:07.280
Right?

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:12.320
Actually... I've come here
to escape from my past.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.880
What's so dark about your past?

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:18.500
I shot a man.

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.840
Why aren't you in jail, then?

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:29.160
He didn't die.

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:30.820
Only one ear got blown off.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.130
It bled quite a bit though.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.400
What happened?

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:42.440
Please eat!

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:44.860
Come on, guys!

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.050
Shakuntala's obviously joking.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:02.760
She's joking!

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.310
I was going to start sleeping
with a stick at night!

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:16.780
Tarabai, I scared your houseguests
right on arrival, didn't I!

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.320
A girl who follows her heart

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.050
and laughs with abandon...

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.200
What could be more
scary to men?

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:25.580
I swear.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.810
I've never understood this disparity
between men and women!

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.410
That's why you're so special!

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.890
You managed to escape the
Dheeraj incident and get here.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.000
But how will you
pay next month's rent?

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.510
I have my Maths!

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.390
A Math show, did you say, love?

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.480
Yes!

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.200
People are giving
me difficult sums...

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.770
And I am giving them
answers quickly-quickly!

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:49.750
Why do you think people
will part with their good money...

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:51.570
To see something stupid like that?

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.610
I can't possibly allow my girls

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.980
who come from all over the world...

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:02.210
To be exposed to this mumbo-jumbo!

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.810
An Indian woman
in a sari and pigtails

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:09.250
doing mathematical
sums on stage is a joke!

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:14.930
Sir. Joke also - Indian
man in loincloth with a stick.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.620
But he won!

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.290
There you are.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:44.690
All yours.

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.060
That's astonishing.
How did you do that?

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:09.250
I'm correct?

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:11.100
Indeed you are!

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:12.600
Thank you.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.490
Is audience having
any more question for me?

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:20.570
Great stuff with the mathematics...

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:25.230
But we're going to need a translator
for this fresh-off-the-boat English!

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.500
Excuse me.

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:37.490
That was...

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:42.490
Did they teach you some special
mental-math technique at University?

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.230
I'm never going to any school.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.160
Then how University?

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.730
You didn't go to school?

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.970
I'm having no childhood only...

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:54.160
I'm Javier, by the way.

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:56.140
'Havee', means?

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.390
J-A-V-I-E-R. Javier.

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:00.920
What happened to J?

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.300
The J is silent.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.550
See! Alphabets, so much confusion.

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:08.560
Numbers, no confusion!

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.530
What you see is what you getting.

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:11.930
What you're getting is a cold.

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:12.960
Yes.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.640
Because, it's 'Hanuary', no?
The J is silent!

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.720
Would you care for
a hot English cup of tea?

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.030
Sure!

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:31.860
Three spoons of sugar!

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:35.820
Otherwise your English Chai
is not having any taste only.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.490
I'm not English.
I'm from Spain originally.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:44.250
Oh I see!
All you white guys look the same!

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:49.570
Shakuntala, what is it that
you love about being on stage?

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:55.370
People's faces, when they see
a girl in chotis doing maths.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:56.610
Choti?

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:57.900
Plaits!

00:22:58.150 --> 00:22:58.770
Oh!

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:07.030
So many years people are singing,
dancing, doing drama, circus on stage.

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.800
Then why I cannot do Maths on stage?

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.700
Shakuntala, then allow me to take
your Math performance to the next level!

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:15.920
Next level?

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:17.030
You mean third floor?

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:22.100
The world needs to see you,
Shakuntala.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:28.360
But it would require what one
would call a bit of a... makeover?

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.770
But I have one condition...

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:34.050
Mr 'Javier With J Silent'.

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:38.400
Means...
my Saree isn't going anywhere.

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:39.960
God-Promise.

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:42.010
What?

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:46.270
Means, if you are
breaking this promise...

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.250
I will lose all my talent.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.130
That's pretty dramatic.

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:52.360
We Indians are like that only.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.680
Drama or nothing!

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:04.330
"Betty Botter bought
a bit of butter..."

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:07.410
"But the butter Betty Botter bought was
a bit bitter and made her batter bitter."

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.730
"Crazy Camels, Calm Camels,
the Camel Clans Clashed!"

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.800
I thought I was the teacher here.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.480
Teaching means learning everyday,
J-Silent.

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:18.000
Okay, you go first.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.460
"Betty Botter bought
a bit of butter..."

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.020
"But the butter Betty Botter bought was
a bit bitter and made her batter bitter."

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:26.510
Now you!

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.280
Donning butterfly wings

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:49.250
To the west the easterlies blow

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.810
Washing over this Spring

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:57.080
Is an all new glow

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:00.550
Save the heart from the evil eye

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:04.040
With all the joy it's taken in

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:08.620
I dream in English now

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:11.090
Life's made a new beginning

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.900
This story's taken a turn

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:18.800
I do what the heart yearns

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:23.430
Never mind the English Queen

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:25.880
It's Queen India reigning supreme!

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:29.830
This story's taken a turn

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.430
I do what the heart yearns

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:38.200
Never mind the English Queen

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:40.660
It's Queen India reigning supreme!

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:44.540
Now say, Mrs. Astrid Moore
asks you to multiply

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:51.380
Take the first digit, which is 8
And multiply it by 8+1 which is...

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.560
Nine!

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.240
Multiply 8 X 9, which is

00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:00.310
Take the two 5's from the
units place and multiply them.

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:01.670
5 X 5 is...

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:07.290
Put the two together
and what's your answer?

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:23.600
How are you?

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.430
Jolly good. How about you?

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:26.620
I'm a bit poorly.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.910
Oh blimey!
Let me get you a cup of tea!

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.300
Ah, that's so awfully kind of you!

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:33.590
Thank you!

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.400
Now onto the next trick.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.600
May I request His Excellency,
the Spanish Ambassador

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.600
to tell us his favourite year?

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.310
That would be 1935, Senorita.

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:46.220
And favourite date in a month?

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.470
Let's see... the 14th!

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:49.460
Okay.

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:53.210
Now I am going to tell you
on which days of the week

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:56.610
the 14th of each
month occurred in 1935.

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:57.510
Please check!

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.120
Beginning with January...

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.660
- Am I correct?
- Si Si perfecto, Senora!

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.470
Gracias!

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.010
This story's taken a turn

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:22.360
I do what the heart yearns

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:26.080
Never mind the English Queen

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.710
It's Queen India reigning supreme!

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.180
Tarabai! I got five more shows!.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.840
I'll pay this month's
rent in advance!

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.560
Look who's rolling in riches!

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.030
There's a letter for you from home.

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:55.420
Dear Shakuntala...

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:58.550
It's been six months
since you left for London...

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:01.710
And you haven't
sent a penny home yet.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:05.220
You know your father's temper...

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:08.780
So I'm writing this
letter with Srinivas' help.

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.840
Don't you have any responsibility
towards your family?

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:16.160
Sharda's no more,
but we're still here.

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:23.150
They treat me like a bank,
not a daughter!

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:25.490
Didn't even ask once,
'Shaku, how are you?'

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:28.340
That doesn't mean
they don't love you!

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:30.370
They've never asked, Tarabai!

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:32.910
And from now on, I won't ask either.

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:35.570
Wait, Shakuntala!

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:41.460
Mother, you needn't
write to me again.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.280
You will get your money every month.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.020
Dear friends across the airwaves...

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.070
Let's see if ShakuntalaDevi
makes India proud next!

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:05.270
shall compete against the fastest
computer on London's top TV channel!

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:08.690
After the great Aryabhatt
and Ramanujan...

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:12.570
Let's see if Shakuntala
Devi makes India proud next!

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.220
Stay calm...

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:15.690
Speak clearly...

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.790
Don't get nervous.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.380
J-Silent, be silent.

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:23.830
My numbers never let me down.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:25.370
Shakuntala...

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:29.220
There is something
I need to tell you.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.610
"Crazy Camels, Calm Camels..."

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:39.210
"The Camel Clans Clashed!"

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:46.650
That's right!

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.530
Not bad Ms. Devi, not bad at all.

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:52.850
Now Ms. Devi,could you
give us the cube root of

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.630
923. Am I correct?

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:07.800
Ms. Devi, I think we are ready
to take this to the next level!

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.980
You mean third floor?

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:09.880
I'm sorry?

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:13.320
It would be my absolute pleasure.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:19.060
Ms. Devi, are you able
to give us the cube root of

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:31.800
Come on, Ms. Devi.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.220
All of India is looking
at you with bated breath.

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.640
I'm afraid this question is wrong.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.970
Are you suggesting the
computer is wrong, Ms. Devi?

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.100
The computer has already
given its answer.

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:45.730
The question is not wrong.

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.880
I could show you where
the computer went wrong.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.170
Thanks to Lord Ganesha,
my answers are never wrong.

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:54.220
This isn't the Great
Indian Rope Trick, Ms. Devi.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:57.260
Though you do look like
you're at the end of your rope.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.050
No, the computer has made a mistake.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:01.580
Actually, three mistakes...

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.460
You know, I was quite excited
that a lady mathematician

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:06.970
from the land of snake
charmers and elephants

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:09.020
could somehow beat the computer.

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.300
But not everyone can
be Einstein, can they?

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:15.350
All I'm asking you is to check the last
three digits of the number please...

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:17.430
Unfortunately, that's all
we have time for today.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:18.110
No, can you-

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:20.050
- Goodnight and see you next week!
- Can you please check it once?

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:27.940
He's right, isn't he?

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:31.300
Humans make mistakes,
computers don't. Right?

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.320
But I can't be wrong!

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.290
Why? Aren't you human?

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:38.150
The entire country
had its eyes on me.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.920
Everyone's laughing at me, Tarabai.

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.740
Shakuntala! Shakuntala.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.370
Someone's here to see you,
come down quick!

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:00.440
I don't want to meet anyone.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:05.010
Just come! And wash your face.
Enough of this crying!

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:06.110
Come on quickly.

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:11.340
Good morning.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.610
Is this any time to
show me your silly grin?

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:17.810
The TV has been flooded
with calls from people

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:20.420
asking them to re-check
the question last night!

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:22.350
I made a few calls myself!

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.140
Had gin early in the morning?

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.030
The people got experts
to do the calculations manually...

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.370
And you were right!

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:32.140
The computer made a rounding error.

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:35.590
That's exactly that I
was trying to tell that idiot...

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:38.270
That the last three digits
of that number were jumbled up!

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:40.350
Darling you're speaking
in Hindi again!

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:41.920
The number they gave me was

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.940
And he said the answer is 166917.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:54.330
But when any number ending in 7 is
multiplied by itself three times...

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:56.070
The answer has to end in 3!

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:59.590
So the cube of 166917
has to end in 3!

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:01.630
So the correct question
would have been

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.310
I was correct.
The computer was wrong!

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:12.890
And that's why they named
you the Human Computer!

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:14.100
Huh?

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.750
God-promise!

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:19.080
You're all over the papers. Look.

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:29.700
Shakuntala...

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.090
My Human Computer.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:35.660
The world is calling.

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:38.480
Are you ready?

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.000
Are you done?

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:01.000
- Done.
- Okay.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.180
So do you want me to
give you the answer

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:08.530
from left to right or right to left?

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:10.660
I'll give it to you from
right to left. Please take it down?

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:11.720
The answer is...

00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:19.480
Am I correct?

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:22.920
Absolutely correct!

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.320
Sari-clad calculating prodigy
confounds Maths experts

00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:41.220
The Indian Human Computer
wows Europe

00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:43.000
Devi in Demand: Makes
Maths Entertaining

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.580
Human Computer knows how
to convert her Maths into Money!

00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:52.600
Shakuntala Devi: A True
Rags-to-Riches story

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.900
Shelly!

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:05.580
Shakuntala!

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.360
Tarabai!

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.090
Welcome to Shakuntala's palace!

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:13.970
British house, British clothes!

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.510
But I still only wear
sarees at my shows, Tarabai!

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:20.220
So how many cities did
you tour last month, Shakuntala?

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:22.740
Thirteen, my dear Gordanbhai!

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:23.800
Goodness!

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.620
I haven't seen thirteen
cities in my entire lifetime!

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.130
Why, Tarabai!

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:29.930
We're humans, not trees.

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:31.670
We have legs, not roots.

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:32.530
Tell me why?

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.330
Why?

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.410
So we can roam the world!

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:36.230
Shakuntala...

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.680
J-Silent... Hi!

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:39.800
Can we talk?

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:45.530
What do you mean,
you're going back to Spain?

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:49.110
You always knew this day would come.

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.400
I also know I'm
going to die someday.

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.640
Doesn't mean I'm okay with it.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.290
You are rich and famous!

00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:59.720
You don't need me, Shakuntala.

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:03.060
Why do men always
want women to need them?

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:06.250
Shakuntala, I'm sorry...

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.570
Javier With J Silent...

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:16.650
I'm sorry that my love
isn't enough for you.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.390
Go.

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:24.460
Find someone who needs you.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:28.930
Go!

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:58.550
Look Sharda, I've become
such a big woman.

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:04.970
But you're still the one I talk to
in the middle of the night.

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:08.900
Cheers!

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.120
I'll talk to her.

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:19.640
- No.
- Yeah, let me talk to her!

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.520
- No!
- Let's end this daily soap opera.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.790
Let's just finish it off and-

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:23.920
No, no Ajay!

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.660
- No. Please, no!
- Why not?

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.080
You know I don't
want to talk to her!

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.560
- Okay fine, but I can-
- Ajay, no.

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:29.450
Why not?

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:33.400
Sorry sir! It took a while
to get the keys from office.

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:34.520
Please come.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:48.000
They told me in the office that
you're Shakuntala Devi's daughter.

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:54.840
You're so lucky...

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.770
Your mother's such a genius!

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:02.370
I was ten years old when
she visited our school...

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:05.400
She changed my life.

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:08.400
I was a duffer in class,
and I became a topper!

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.720
Your Maths must be very good too.
Right, ma'am?

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:14.250
I hate Maths.

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:20.620
Okay, there are two bedrooms here.

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:23.080
You can build more rooms upstairs,
if you plan to have kids in the future.

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.570
We're never having kids.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:26.890
Sorry, sir.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.710
We're not buying this
house for ourselves.

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:32.590
Anu's business,
I mean our business ...

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:35.860
We buy such houses,
refurbish them...

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:37.960
We decorate and resell them.

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:42.000
I see! So different
from Shakuntala Devi, no?

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:45.200
Yes, I'm nothing
like Shakuntala Devi...

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.410
And I'm buying this house,
not Shakuntala Devi.

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.150
I hate Maths and I don't want
to ever be a mother.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.480
Will you still sell us this house

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:52.770
or should we call another broker?

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:58.460
Ajay...

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:00.440
Didn't I tell you before marriage...

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.590
That you don't want kids.
And I respect that.

00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:05.370
But why did you get
mad at that poor guy?

00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:07.360
I'm tired, Ajay.

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:10.570
Everyone just sees me
as Shakuntala Devi's daughter.

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:12.070
But I only see you!

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:15.890
I know my dreams aren't big...

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:18.340
But they're your own!

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.490
Own it!

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:24.280
Exactly.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.130
Exactly!

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.150
I don't want to be a genius.

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:28.000
Don't be one!

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.250
I don't want to conquer the world.

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:29.890
We won't.

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:31.610
I don't want to be on the covers
of top magazines.

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:33.970
- Or be on TV.
- Then don't!

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:36.790
Aunty, please have this.

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:38.150
Ma, have this. I've made it.

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:40.080
Sure, I believe you.

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:44.640
Such a cutie-pie he is!

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:46.390
Do you know...

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:49.940
Before he was born,
we had a puppy too.

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:52.690
I was always away,
thanks to my posting.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.000
So the puppy gave her
company as well as practice.

00:39:57.090 --> 00:39:58.350
Practice for what?

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.390
Taking care of babies!

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:07.010
Ajay. I need to get
the lasagna out of the oven.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:08.070
Can you come help?

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.480
Excuse me.

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:16.520
Nice smell!

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:19.210
What?

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:23.490
That's the oven bell ringing,
not my biological clock!

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:24.930
So don't get too excited!

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.300
What are you talking about?

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.840
Did you think Dennis will
awaken my maternal instincts?

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.490
I'll suddenly turn
into Mother India?

00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:34.540
If this was so important to you,
why did you marry me?

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:35.930
It was just a gift!

00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:37.820
I wanted to see a smile
on your face, that's it!

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:39.500
Then why did your
mom mention a baby?

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:40.860
Why don't you go ask her?

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.740
My mother doesn't
represent me, okay?

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:45.880
And till you keep obsessing
about your mother...

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.680
Things will never
work out between us!

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:05.540
Plan to serve lasagna,
or a divorce notice?

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:12.030
How will it work
if we both overreact?

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:26.960
Sorry?

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:34.190
Marriage means always
having to say you're sorry.

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:45.710
I must be the world's
biggest fool in love.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.230
You're the second biggest.

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:51.370
Who's Number One, then?

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:06.660
Sir. Shakuntala Ma'am
sent this for you.

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:14.050
Help, help! I'm dying of boredom.

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:22.340
Shakuntala!

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:24.150
I've been waiting
for you for so long!

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:25.170
Who's this?

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:26.070
Dushyant!

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:28.480
Shakuntala's lover across lifetimes!

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.350
Yes, but only in India, okay?

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.940
I have different lovers
in different countries.

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.150
How many countries?

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:37.780
Well, my goal is 150 lovers
across 150 countries.

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:39.330
I haven't found
anyone in Iceland yet.

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:40.830
Do you know anyone there?

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:43.560
Ms. Devi, we must get going.

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:44.730
Excuse us.

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:47.940
- Good day.
- Good day, Ms. Devi.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.730
150 countries. Good Lord!

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.890
Hello, Dushyant!

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.440
Paritosh Banerji. IAS. Hi.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.490
So you're a Bureaucratic Superhero?

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:06.640
You have to be a superhero
when you work for the government.

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.360
Then prove it and rescue me
From this boring party.

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:18.270
O my darlin'

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:22.260
On this dreamy night

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:25.870
With the stars so bright

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.370
It's time to shine and dazzle

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:31.240
Shine and dazzle, oh yes!

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:33.040
Why yes..

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:37.200
Let's soak in the rain

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:40.830
Whispering sweet nothings

00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:42.080
Dance?

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.600
Let's shine and dazzle

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.200
Shine and dazzle, oh yes!

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.880
Why yes...

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.650
Let's soak in the rain

00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:14.950
Tiptoe over to me

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:17.130
Your lover's waiting eagerly

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:19.660
You know what?
I was going to cancel this trip.

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:21.250
Are you afraid of flying?

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:26.180
I hate being out of Calcutta
even for four days.

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:30.470
And I hate being in any city
for more than four days!

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:32.130
- We are doomed.
- Opposites attract!

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:34.300
Let's write upon the skies

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.070
This tale of yours and mine

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:38.350
How two hearts meet

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:41.130
And melt in a love so sweet, oh yes!

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:43.130
Why yes...

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:46.430
Tiptoe over to me

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:47.900
I have a confession to make.

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:52.640
My track record is sketchy.
I'm divorced.

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:55.080
Congratulations.

00:44:56.810 --> 00:44:59.160
If you weren't divorced,
you wouldn't be here!

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:04.490
Why yes..

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:08.630
Let's soak in the rain

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:11.530
Whispering sweet nothings

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.430
Let's shine and dazzle

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:17.440
Shine and dazzle, oh yes!

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.190
Why yes...

00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:22.870
Let's soak in the rain

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:33.780
I'll miss you a lot.

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:41.440
And what if I said
you won't have to miss me?

00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:45.450
What do you mean?

00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:49.030
Let's go. I'll come along with you.

00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:56.340
Let me see what Calcutta has,
that you are unable to leave.

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:04.810
And what if I don't
let you leave Calcutta?

00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:16.780
This is the finest
house in Ballygunge.

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.410
This street's called Party Street.

00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:22.460
In Calcutta, 'party' can also mean
political party!

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.180
You know, the number
of this house is 720.

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:31.590
Which is 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6

00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:33.570
As well as 8 x 9 x 10.

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:36.070
Poor 7 got left out.

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:38.250
Wow. And whose house is this?

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:40.620
Mine!

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.020
As in?

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:44.510
I bought it.

00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:46.820
- When?
- Last evening.

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:49.670
Have you gone crazy?

00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:51.910
I liked it, so I bought it.

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.030
Besides...

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:58.500
You'll be happier here than
in your dreary official residence.

00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:01.410
Are you proposing to me?

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.780
I want a baby with an intelligent
and good-looking man, after all!

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:15.720
Never thought I'd hear
that word from your mouth.

00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:18.440
Why, it's such a simple word!

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:20.380
B-A-B-Y, baby.

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:21.890
You can't settle in one place...

00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:23.930
You're out to conquer
the world, and...

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:25.920
And a mother can't do that?

00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:31.330
You can do anything you want.

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:34.450
So, tell me...

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:37.090
When do I bring the
wedding procession?

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:39.110
I asked for a baby.

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:40.240
Not a husband!

00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:45.690
Shakuntala.

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:48.770
My parents...

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:50.850
Are against our relationship.

00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:52.520
I don't care. Do you?

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:56.060
I want to meet your parents.

00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.520
I want their blessings.

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:09.950
Take a left from ahead.

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.320
You'll cross some cows
and buffaloes on the way.

00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:15.510
You'll see my mother
doing all the housework...

00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:17.240
And my father will be there too...

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:20.060
Reading the newspaper
sitting on his ancient chair.

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:25.080
Won't you come along?

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:27.770
You wanted their blessings, not me.

00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:34.800
Forgive them, Shakuntala.

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:38.480
Maybe love will prevail over duty?

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:42.280
I can't forgive them.

00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:44.940
I had no expectations
from my father anyway.

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:48.460
Whoever was of no use
to him, didn't exist.

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:50.980
But my mother ...

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:55.920
She just stood there like a statue.

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.040
Helpless.

00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:00.360
Weak. Mute.

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:04.300
She never spoke up for herself...

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:08.250
She could have at least opened her
mouth to save her daughter from death.

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:25.190
I wanted to do this in
front of your parents, but...

00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:34.430
Shakuntala, I love you very much.

00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:38.130
Marry me, please?

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.800
Isn't the diamond a bit
small for a wedding ring?

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:50.840
It's perfect for me.

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:54.360
That's because you've become
used to settling for less.

00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:03.970
After 200 calls, I thought
you called me here to say sorry.

00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:08.100
I called you to know why
despite being my daughter...

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:12.820
How can marriage be
your only ambition, Anu!

00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:15.640
My only ambition is
to not become like you.

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:25.610
I know how successful
and famous you are.

00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:27.390
You never stop reminding me, do you?

00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:29.820
At least take a look, Anu...

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.470
Compliments from the chef.

00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:34.770
Shakuntala Maam, it's an
absolute honour to serve you.

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:36.120
How sweet.

00:50:36.610 --> 00:50:41.740
When today's generation recognizes me,
I feel I've done something right.

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.800
And if you don't

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:46.780
she takes out her 'Black-Book'
to show you how famous she is.

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:48.530
Ignore her.

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:49.890
Thank you.

00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:56.550
- Just see it once, Anu...
- Stop it Ma.

00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:58.800
I'm tired of being
on this rollercoaster!

00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:00.720
I'm tired of being your daughter.

00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:03.350
This is that boy speaking, not you.

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:07.010
You've lost your identity, Anu!

00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:10.330
Just divorce him, I say!

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:12.140
Come home with me.

00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:18.280
All my properties, shares, money...
it's all for you, isn't it?

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:28.100
I don't need you or your money.

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:31.910
Anu!

00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:34.810
Actually Ma, I'm divorcing you.

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:40.930
How can anyone divorce their mother!

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:43.220
Why... Didn't you?

00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:54.300
You'll understand
when you have a daughter.

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:58.400
Because of you,
I never want to be a mother.

00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:04.960
That's what happens.

00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:09.390
Sometimes when you're least
expecting it, you're expecting.

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:13.210
That's what we call
the miracle of life.

00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:16.800
It's been 8 weeks. Congratulations.

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:20.470
Anu, you're going to be a mom.

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:22.810
Anu!

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.880
Anu!

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:26.860
Anu!

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.840
Look, I won't lie.

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.550
Today's the happiest day of my life.

00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:38.780
A child is a responsibility
of a lifetime.

00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:39.680
I know.

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.860
Everyone handles it. We can too!

00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:43.810
Not everyone can handle it, Ajay.

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:48.310
Just for once, forget all
your baggage and your parents.

00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:49.930
Listen to your heart.

00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:52.140
How do you feel?

00:52:54.550 --> 00:52:57.650
I feel... thrilled.

00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:03.380
I feel so happy that...

00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:05.240
it scares me.

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:08.580
Yes!

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.350
Sorry, we're having a baby.

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.050
If it's a girl, we'll call
her Amritha. Amrit if it's a boy.

00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:14.400
You're making a scene!

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:15.870
We're making a family!

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.850
My baby!

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:22.980
Our baby.

00:53:24.590 --> 00:53:26.450
I'm the one with
3 inch long stitches.

00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:27.940
But sure, 'our baby'.

00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:29.810
Okay fine, your baby.

00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:18.040
What happened, Shakuntala?

00:54:21.970 --> 00:54:22.970
Is Anu okay?

00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:24.610
Yes.

00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:28.910
What's the matter?

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:33.520
Paritosh, I'm not just a mother.

00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:35.650
I'm still me.

00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.940
As in?

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:43.960
When I recite rhymes to Anu,
my mind buzzes with numbers.

00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:47.130
When she hears the rattle and claps

00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:49.420
I miss the applause of my audience.

00:54:49.810 --> 00:54:51.970
When I look at the verandah,
it reminds me of my stage.

00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:56.970
Why aren't you on stage, then?

00:55:00.810 --> 00:55:02.010
What about Anu?

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:04.280
Anu has two parents, Shakuntala.

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:09.530
You mean I can do my shows?

00:55:12.850 --> 00:55:15.550
Since when did you start
asking for permission?

00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:18.940
Outside India too?

00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:25.910
If you lose a part of yourself

00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:28.860
we'll lose a part of us, right?

00:55:34.570 --> 00:55:35.390
Okay.

00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:36.810
Okay!

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:42.860
The problem got solved so easily!

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:45.590
And I was expecting fireworks.

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:49.460
We can still have fireworks.

00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.990
Shakuntala, you're getting late.

00:55:58.070 --> 00:55:58.920
Give her to me.

00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:01.730
It's time for your flight.

00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:07.430
Go now.

00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:22.480
When I told my manager that I wanted
to start doing my math shows again

00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:23.540
he was shocked.

00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:27.080
He said, 'But ma'am,
you've just had a baby!'

00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:28.850
I said, 'Why?'

00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:32.230
'Have I turned into
a different person?'

00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:35.010
Do women lose their brains
after becoming mothers?

00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:42.250
So today, shall we see if this new
mother's brain is still working or not?

00:56:42.610 --> 00:56:44.250
Can I have the questions please?

00:56:44.490 --> 00:56:46.460
Ms. Devi, the questions
from the audience.

00:56:47.090 --> 00:56:48.770
The first question...

00:56:55.170 --> 00:56:56.350
Thank you.

00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:05.580
Thank you.

00:57:15.930 --> 00:57:17.070
How are you doing it?

00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:18.160
How?

00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:22.970
Ma Genius: Ready
to conquer the world

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:34.670
That took 50 seconds.

00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:36.390
The computer is
still calculating.

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:41.320
There it is. The computer
got it in 62 seconds.

00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:42.290
She's right!

00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:46.490
Ms. Devi calculated the
23rd root of a 201 digit number

00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:49.120
Faster than the fastest computer,
the UNIVAC!

00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:52.730
Thank you.

00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:55.430
Ms. Devi, how?

00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:57.000
How do you do it?

00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:57.790
How!

00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:03.850
Shakuntala Devi's magic spreads
across the world! What's her secret?

00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:11.520
Are you ready?

00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:13.950
Okay, the answer is...

00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:29.990
Am I correct?

00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:35.440
That's absolutely correct.

00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:36.780
Thank you.

00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:40.050
This is the largest mental
multiplication ever done

00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:42.820
In record time by a human being!

00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:46.280
I think Ms. Devi just made it to
the Guinness Book of World Records!

00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:48.960
How do you do it Ms. Devi?

00:58:56.550 --> 00:58:59.370
The question on everyone's mind:
How does she do it?

00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:04.010
What is the cube root of

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:09.510
Correct!

00:59:09.590 --> 00:59:11.150
What is the cube root of

00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:23.040
So, did you find out how I do it?

00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:26.600
Ms. Devi, your rather
unexceptional reaction times

00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:29.420
on a battery of elementary
cognitive tasks.

00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:32.930
which were compared with the
mean RTs of adults on the same tests

00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:35.010
Contrasts so markedly with your

00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:38.150
amazing speed of performing
huge arithmetic calculations

00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:40.300
as to indicate that
your skill with numbers

00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:43.940
must depend largely on the
automatic encoding and retrieval

00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:48.150
of a wealth of declarative and procedural
information in long term memory

00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:51.830
rather than on any
unusual basic capacities.

00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:54.280
English please.

00:59:54.850 --> 00:59:55.990
After all the tests...

00:59:56.070 --> 01:00:00.380
We cannot really explain
how exactly you do it, Ms. Devi.

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:08.540
How could those English
scientists know...

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:11.750
It's impossible to decipher
the great Shakuntala Devi.

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:13.350
Exactly!

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:15.940
So, what's my daughter up to?

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:19.700
Your daughter just spoke
her first word... Daddy!

01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:22.910
Daddy...

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.920
Remember those musical shoes
you got her from the States?

01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:30.990
She runs around the house in them,
chanting "Daddy, Daddy!"

01:00:34.930 --> 01:00:35.520
Hello?

01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:37.200
Hello.

01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:38.420
Hello.

01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.850
Hello.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:40.940
Hello?

01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:43.210
Hello, I can't hear you.

01:00:44.010 --> 01:00:44.860
Hello?

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:45.630
Hello?

01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:47.100
Hello?

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:01.450
I don't understand.

01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:04.310
Why can't the three of
us travel the world together?

01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:05.830
I belong here, in Calcutta.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.980
I thought we belonged together.

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:09.520
What will I do there?

01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:11.560
You'll be busy with your shows!

01:01:11.970 --> 01:01:14.630
And I'm not your stepney.

01:01:18.350 --> 01:01:21.160
If you were a world
famous mathematician

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:23.200
doing shows worldwide...

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:26.000
Not just you,
the whole world would expect me

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.140
to pack my bags and
string along with you.

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:31.970
I've always supported
you and your career!

01:01:32.050 --> 01:01:32.730
Thanks!

01:01:32.810 --> 01:01:36.010
I've taken care of Anu
when you haven't been around!

01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:40.690
Wow. You deserve a Nobel prize for
taking care of your own daughter!

01:01:40.770 --> 01:01:43.800
Like you get prizes for
abandoning your daughter?

01:01:46.350 --> 01:01:47.000
This.

01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:49.420
This is what you really are!

01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:54.080
You're just like all the other men!

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:57.630
What are you doing!

01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:59.690
Have you gone crazy?

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.280
Paritosh.

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.510
Maths is everything to me.

01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:42.760
But Anu's even more
important than Maths.

01:02:43.030 --> 01:02:46.090
I'm sorry.
I said those things in anger.

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.920
If you don't want to
come with me...

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.810
That's your choice.

01:02:54.530 --> 01:02:56.240
But Anu will stay with me now.

01:02:56.970 --> 01:02:58.670
She'll go wherever I go.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:00.610
She's a child, Shakuntala...

01:03:00.690 --> 01:03:04.410
Not a suitcase to
be dragged city to city.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.220
I can't stay without
my daughter anymore.

01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:09.270
I can't stay without her either!

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:14.360
I gave birth to her.

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.010
I have three inch
long stitches on me.

01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:18.760
I have more right on her.

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:21.760
Just giving birth doesn't
make one a mother, Shakuntala.

01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:25.710
I'll be the world's best mother!

01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:35.910
Shakuntala!

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:56.850
Dear Dad.

01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:59.950
London is nothing like the
descriptions in storybooks.

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:01.810
There are just two
kinds of weather here.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.360
Rain and winter.

01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:06.600
I want to come to Calcutta.

01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:09.320
I wait for your letter everyday.

01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:11.810
I miss you a lot, Dad.

01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:14.110
The world needs to
discover Vedic Maths.

01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:15.750
Just like my daughter Anu has.

01:04:15.830 --> 01:04:16.660
Say Hello, Anu.

01:04:16.790 --> 01:04:17.730
This is Edward.

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:20.320
- Hello.
- Hi. Hello.

01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:22.590
Go on, Edward. Ask her a question!

01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:24.530
Oh. That won't be necessary.

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:26.030
No, I insist.

01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:27.320
Ask her!

01:04:30.070 --> 01:04:31.930
What's 409 square?

01:04:35.350 --> 01:04:36.150
Correct!

01:04:36.310 --> 01:04:37.410
How did she do that?

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:38.550
Tell him, sweetie.

01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:43.960
So the first two digits of the
answer will be the first digit.

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.920
4 square, which is 16.

01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:49.880
And the last two digits of the
answer will be the last digit.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:52.100
9 square, which is 81.

01:04:52.490 --> 01:04:56.420
And the middle two digits are two
times of the first and last number.

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:59.860
That's 2x4x9. Which is 72.

01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:03.130
So the answer is 167281.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.710
Very good!

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.790
I got a three-book deal,
only because of you.

01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:10.970
Thank you!

01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:14.010
Please post this to Dad.

01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:15.270
What's this?

01:05:15.930 --> 01:05:17.160
A letter for him.

01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:18.950
Don't forget.

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:21.870
Don't forget!

01:05:25.770 --> 01:05:26.590
Yes ma'am.

01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:28.650
Shall we go to the park?

01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:33.190
My mind wants to go to the park.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.230
But my instinct says...

01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:39.200
Sorry, Anu.

01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:42.700
Sorry!

01:05:43.350 --> 01:05:44.320
Dear Dad.

01:05:44.850 --> 01:05:47.710
Apart from being a
world-famous Mathematician...

01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:50.390
Ma's now become a
world-famous Astrologer too.

01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:56.400
She says she has both the intellect for
Maths and the instinct for Astrology.

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:59.050
I think Ma's become very rich.

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:07.770
Ma says you don't have
the time to call or write to me.

01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:11.740
Is that true, Dad?

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:17.660
I'll be back in three months,
you can take an appointment then.

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:20.370
Most definitely!

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.690
It's all Lord Ganesha's blessing!

01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:24.440
I'll take your leave.
Goodbye.

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.330
Goodbye!

01:06:27.590 --> 01:06:28.970
What a day, Anu.

01:06:29.330 --> 01:06:30.910
25 appointments!

01:06:31.290 --> 01:06:32.950
What questions did Uncle have?

01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:35.310
Everyone has only two questions.

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:38.500
Will I get money? Will I get love?

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:40.160
But I have another question.

01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:41.200
What?

01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:42.970
Will I get my father?

01:06:46.610 --> 01:06:48.200
I have a question too.

01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:51.360
What do you think of my poster?

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:56.720
'Erase Poverty' isn't
just an empty slogan for me.

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:00.180
I've erased poverty
from my own life.

01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:03.210
Please give me your precious vote...

01:07:03.370 --> 01:07:05.220
I'll remove poverty
and unemployment...

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.160
Dear Dad.

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:09.930
Ma isn't just a mathematician
and astrologer now...

01:07:10.010 --> 01:07:11.710
She's become a politician too.

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:13.950
Everyone says that
she's the only one

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:19.050
Who can defeat Indira
Gandhi in these elections.

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:21.710
The results will be out today.

01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:25.360
Ma... Back so soon?

01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:29.480
Anu...

01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:31.310
Turn off the TV, please.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:32.500
Yes, Ma.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:39.900
Here.

01:07:42.370 --> 01:07:43.280
What's this?

01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:48.590
Are the results out?

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.560
Did you lose?

01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:02.380
Absolutely not.

01:08:02.770 --> 01:08:04.020
I never lose, Anu.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.690
Always remember that.

01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:20.500
Come on, let's pack our bags.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:23.150
I've booked 10 maths shows.

01:08:23.230 --> 01:08:29.040
10 cities. Bombay, Nagpur,
Poona, Hyderabad, Vijayawada.

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.610
I need five numbers.

01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:32.800
Each one of you will
give me one number.

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:33.800
Let's begin!

01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:41.220
Now I'm going to make a
'Magic Square' with these 5 digits.

01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:45.240
Add up any row or column
and you'll get the same answer.

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.430
Want to see how?

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:51.590
What's the answer?

01:08:57.170 --> 01:08:57.610
What's the answer?

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:09.070
Dear Dad, I go to so
many schools with Ma.

01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:12.210
But I want to go to my own school.

01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:13.750
In one place.

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:15.880
I don't want to travel the world.

01:09:16.170 --> 01:09:17.710
Please do something, Dad.

01:09:17.790 --> 01:09:18.480
Anu?

01:09:19.770 --> 01:09:20.580
Please?

01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:22.100
Please?

01:09:23.650 --> 01:09:24.260
Cheers!

01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:25.220
Cheers.

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:31.800
So?

01:09:32.490 --> 01:09:35.870
All the way from Calcutta to Bombay.
How come?

01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:41.370
How's my daughter?

01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:44.750
She's happy.

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:47.310
I really enjoy reading her letters.

01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:53.620
You didn't give her
any of my letters, did you?

01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:57.060
She wouldn't be able
to handle it, Paritosh.

01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:59.210
Between two continents
and two parents...

01:09:59.350 --> 01:10:00.360
She'd be torn.

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.440
And confused.

01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:04.530
I've heard it many times.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:10.930
Shakuntala, please put her
in a proper school now.

01:10:11.010 --> 01:10:11.830
Please.

01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:16.340
'Proper' schools kill
creativity in children.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:18.910
Besides, Anu travels the world!

01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:21.350
She meets intellectuals
from various countries.

01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:23.010
It's the best kind of education.

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:25.700
You're doing this for yourself,
not for Anu.

01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:29.480
You want Anu to be
with you all the time.

01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:31.880
Yes, I do. Why not?

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.400
She's my daughter.

01:10:33.610 --> 01:10:34.890
I have every right on her.

01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:36.680
Anu's your daughter.

01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:38.200
You don't own her.

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:41.420
Children can claim their parents
for the rest of their lives...

01:10:42.370 --> 01:10:44.720
But parents can't claim
their children forever.

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:46.460
That's the universal rule of life.

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:48.700
I don't believe in
such pathetic rules.

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.240
You're behaving exactly
like your father.

01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:01.300
You're stealing Anu's childhood
just like he stole yours.

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:04.370
How dare you compare me to that man!

01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:09.030
I'm nothing like him.

01:11:15.790 --> 01:11:21.210
Shakuntala, put Anu in a proper
school this academic year, or else...

01:11:23.770 --> 01:11:25.760
I'll have to go to
court for her custody.

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:27.990
Not joint..

01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:30.470
but full custody.

01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:51.030
You know, for a while I felt
like we still stood a chance, but...

01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:55.320
You don't need me, Shakuntala.

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:58.240
I don't need you, Paritosh.
I love...

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.820
Loved you.

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:07.050
I can't be a nomad like you.

01:12:07.930 --> 01:12:11.640
And I can't be a tree like you.

01:12:23.230 --> 01:12:26.550
From Shimla to the Nilgiri Hills...

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:30.240
Here are the brochures for
India's best boarding schools.

01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:33.070
Choose.

01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:49.010
- I don't get this.
- What? This is so easy!

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.710
Surprise!

01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:52.970
Hello girls!

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.180
Aren't these skirts a bit too long?

01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:56.410
Get a scissor and snip them!

01:12:57.470 --> 01:13:01.390
Anu, my baby...
I missed you!

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:04.900
Come on, give me a hug!

01:13:05.050 --> 01:13:06.290
Summer holidays start in 4 days.

01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:09.140
I know. But I managed
to coax your principal.

01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:12.640
We're going to Nairobi tomorrow,
then Cape Town, Toronto, Paris...

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:13.810
Lucky Anu!

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:17.490
I spend summer holidays on my sofa,
in KPBB mode.

01:13:17.630 --> 01:13:18.880
What's 'KPBB'?

01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:21.900
'Keep Pigging-out
and Become a Buffalo!'

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:23.830
CAJGBPQ!

01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:24.680
What's that?

01:13:25.330 --> 01:13:28.080
C'mon And Just Get
a Bag Packed Quick!

01:13:29.290 --> 01:13:30.760
Okay, bye girls!

01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:34.800
Dear Dad.
It's been ten years since I saw you.

01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:38.890
I want to come to Calcutta
for at least one summer holiday.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:42.910
- My sister Sharda...
- I'm tired of this Shakuntala Devi World Tour.

01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:47.130
We were so poor that we couldn't
afford to take her to a doctor.

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:50.570
Since then, I've tried
to fulfill both our dreams.

01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:53.890
That is so inspiring. So inspiring!

01:13:57.380 --> 01:13:59.830
Now let's talk about
this book launch.

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:00.980
Sure!

01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:05.500
You've taken on quite a
brave and controversial topic...

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:09.260
Don't be scared to say
the title of the book loudly!

01:14:11.210 --> 01:14:13.250
The World of Homosexuals.

01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:15.790
I believe love is love.

01:14:15.930 --> 01:14:18.820
Who we choose to love
is our personal matter.

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:25.190
Given that you aren't
homo...sexual...

01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:27.580
How did you write this book?

01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:30.190
Well I haven't killed
anyone either...

01:14:30.270 --> 01:14:32.370
But I've written a book
called 'Perfect Murder'!

01:14:35.650 --> 01:14:41.160
Actually I got interested
in homosexuality because...

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:43.760
My ex-husband was a homosexual.

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:49.380
I'm so sorry to hear that.
Are you okay?

01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:51.530
No, you should not be sorry.

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:55.290
It is his choice and I support him.

01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:58.760
You are incredibly amazing.
So amazing!

01:14:59.150 --> 01:15:00.250
Thank you.

01:15:04.410 --> 01:15:05.060
Anu.

01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:08.280
Anu!

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:10.980
Anu, stop!

01:15:11.810 --> 01:15:13.960
What is this behaviour, Anu!

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:17.490
"My father was a lion-tamer,
he didn't give me food..."

01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:19.200
"He forced me to do shows..."

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:21.060
"Poor me! Poor me!"

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:23.090
And now you're after my Dad!

01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:25.000
How can you lie through
your teeth like this?

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:27.230
Anu, that...
Anu!

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:29.710
Look at the larger picture!

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:33.210
I want to change people's
attitudes towards homosexuality.

01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:37.900
Personal stories
affect people the most.

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:42.350
If you want to sell something, you
need to weave a story around it...

01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:45.060
A fake story?
That too about my father?

01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:50.230
Why can't you be normal
like other moms?

01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:56.010
Why should I be normal
when I can be amazing?

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:02.840
Can we go home and talk, please?

01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:06.350
Which home? Ritz or Claridges?

01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:09.300
Everyday it's a new hotel room..

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:11.390
I don't know how
it feels to have a home.

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:15.490
Just like I don't know
what it's like to have a mother!

01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:26.290
If only you loved me half
as much as you love Maths...

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:34.470
I want to live with Dad!

01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:46.600
But your father doesn't
want to live with you.

01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:55.270
When he finds out about the
rumours you spread about him...

01:16:55.770 --> 01:16:57.870
Then he'll want me to stay with him!

01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:09.890
Dad! You came from Calcutta!

01:17:09.970 --> 01:17:12.150
I'm becoming a grandfather,
after all...

01:17:12.230 --> 01:17:13.180
Oh God!

01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:14.440
Easy, easy!

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.210
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:19.280
She called you a homosexual.

01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:20.080
So?

01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:23.920
Nothing wrong with
being a homosexual, right?

01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:26.850
According to her,
your entire life is a lie.

01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:29.190
You know I don't care
about all these things.

01:17:29.370 --> 01:17:30.240
But I do!

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.880
I hate that people think
you're living a double-life.

01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:36.340
If there's one thing I've
learnt from your mother...

01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:42.470
It's that life's too short
to care about what others think.

01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:45.530
If you love her so much,
why did you divorce her?

01:17:45.610 --> 01:17:48.750
To love Shakuntala is to let her be.

01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:50.590
She's like a storm.

01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:54.160
And to fight a storm is foolishness.

01:17:54.410 --> 01:17:57.490
So you got all philosophical
and stepped aside.

01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:59.110
I didn't have a choice, Anu.

01:17:59.190 --> 01:18:01.420
Ma didn't hold a gun
to your head, Dad!

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:03.060
You chose to let me go!

01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:06.290
I don't have it in me
to fight your mother.

01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:08.810
You don't have the
courage to fight Ma...

01:18:08.890 --> 01:18:09.880
But I do!

01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:11.440
Anu!

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:13.220
Talk to her, man.

01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:15.630
Uncle it's okay,
you know how she is...

01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:16.860
My water broke!

01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:17.500
What?

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:20.490
Anu!

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:22.000
Call the doctor now!

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:23.600
Ma!

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:27.870
House number 689.

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:32.440
Guess why this number is special?

01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:35.020
All numbers are special to you, Ma.

01:18:36.210 --> 01:18:41.250
Because 689 remains 689,
even upside down.

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:43.010
Fascinating.

01:18:43.090 --> 01:18:44.500
Angry young woman!

01:18:45.690 --> 01:18:49.520
You know, Hyde Park
is just 5 minutes from here!

01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:53.380
Great. People living here
can go there for a walk everyday.

01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:58.570
I've bought this house
for both of us, Anu.

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.650
Let's do lazy Sundays.

01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:04.980
Let's do 'KPBB'!

01:19:07.630 --> 01:19:09.050
What about your Math shows?

01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:11.320
I'm taking a break for a while.

01:19:12.170 --> 01:19:15.190
I want to be your full-time mom.

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:21.860
And you can speak to your Dad too,
if you like.

01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:25.950
No!

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:29.490
Okay, give me the keys!

01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:30.450
Give me the keys!

01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:31.690
Here, here!

01:19:34.290 --> 01:19:37.270
Ma, three floors!

01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:38.220
Happy?

01:19:39.150 --> 01:19:42.110
Ma, can I redecorate
this house on my own?

01:19:42.630 --> 01:19:44.480
You're just 16!

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:46.480
You haven't studied or
trained in interior design.

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:47.880
How will you do it, Anu?

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:49.900
Did you ever do a Maths course?

01:19:50.590 --> 01:19:51.420
Correct.

01:19:52.170 --> 01:19:53.010
Please, Ma?

01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:55.610
I've admired other people's homes
since I was a kid.

01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:59.030
I want to build my own home.

01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:05.700
Okay, let's build our home then!

01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:11.750
Let me capture you

01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:13.970
Right here in my smile

01:20:14.570 --> 01:20:18.770
Lest I lose you again

01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:22.630
O my prized one

01:20:22.710 --> 01:20:24.990
Let me hide you

01:20:25.390 --> 01:20:29.320
Away from prying eyes

01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:36.020
Like a reflection,
I emerged from you

01:20:36.450 --> 01:20:39.820
Why can't I be all you need?

01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:45.210
You're like a puzzle
I've always tried to solve

01:20:45.290 --> 01:20:50.850
Just be my mom
For once and for all?

01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:56.400
You're like a puzzle
I've always tried to solve

01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:01.870
Just be my mom
For once and for all?

01:21:07.330 --> 01:21:10.250
Look, Anu.
There's a pattern in these branches.

01:21:10.330 --> 01:21:13.230
So that every leaf
gets its share of sunlight.

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:16.870
Snowflakes have
similar patterns too.

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.400
Nature's the greatest mathematician.

01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:23.400
Ma... No!

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:25.130
Sorry, sorry...

01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:26.880
No maths.

01:21:32.530 --> 01:21:36.230
Sometimes my very own

01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:38.910
Sometimes a stranger unknown

01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:43.320
You leave me so perplexed

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:49.880
If only for a moment,
I could banish this world

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:54.740
All my heart wants
Is to feel your caresses

01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:57.410
As you untangle my tresses

01:21:57.490 --> 01:22:00.320
Until I drift to sleep

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:04.330
Where else would you want to be?

01:22:04.410 --> 01:22:09.990
Don't leave me alone
To stumble and fall

01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:15.440
Just be my mom
For once and for all?

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:20.970
You're like a puzzle
I've always tried to solve

01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:26.510
Just be my mom
For once and for all?

01:22:31.870 --> 01:22:33.670
Why are you dragging me, Anu?

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:38.980
- We just bought a house!
- Ma, ma...

01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:41.740
This house was built in 1858.

01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:44.010
I want to buy and
refurbish it completely.

01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:45.830
And then we'll rent it out.

01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:48.390
The profits from rent can go
into buying the next property...

01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:50.920
The rent will increase every year
and we'll easily recover the cost.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.610
And we'll add to our properties too.

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:56.700
In whose name shall
I make the cheque?

01:22:57.940 --> 01:23:00.160
Ma, it's a huge amount.

01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:02.060
400,000 pounds.

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:10.670
No amount is too much to
see this twinkle in your eyes!

01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:16.780
When did my little baby grow so big?

01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:23.920
No...

01:23:24.690 --> 01:23:25.520
Sleep, sleep...

01:23:31.190 --> 01:23:33.140
Aw, baby...

01:23:37.390 --> 01:23:38.360
Hush, hush...

01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:49.030
Anu...

01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:51.930
What happened, sweetheart?

01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:56.150
I can't even put
my daughter to sleep!

01:23:58.290 --> 01:24:00.530
It's your first baby!

01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:02.360
Give yourself some time.

01:24:02.850 --> 01:24:04.500
It's been so long.

01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:07.430
Maybe I just don't
have that instinct.

01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:11.440
I'm a really bad mother.

01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:15.500
Can I tell you a secret?

01:24:17.230 --> 01:24:18.880
Every mother is a 'bad mother'.

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:22.650
If she loves her kids too much,
she spoils them.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.970
If she doesn't love them enough,
she still spoils them.

01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:30.290
The perfect mother doesn't exist!

01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:37.230
Something serious...

01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:43.240
My girl!

01:24:46.090 --> 01:24:47.820
Were you two gossiping about me?

01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:50.180
You're not that important.

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:53.730
I was just telling Anu...

01:24:53.810 --> 01:24:56.930
That however she is,
she's a perfect mother.

01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:58.730
That's right.

01:24:59.550 --> 01:25:00.970
The first time I saw her...

01:25:01.050 --> 01:25:02.870
I knew she'd be the perfect mother.

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:07.710
When you first met me, you
thought I had the perfect mother.

01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:08.660
And that!

01:25:10.170 --> 01:25:12.230
They said, "How do you do it?"

01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:14.790
"Ms. Devi!"

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:16.780
Hello.

01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:18.300
Hello, ma'am.

01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:19.170
Hello.

01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:22.060
How do you do it?

01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:24.120
So many Hellos.
Not letting me finish the story...

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:26.170
Good evening, Shakuntala Devi Ma'am!

01:25:26.650 --> 01:25:27.550
Big fan.

01:25:28.030 --> 01:25:29.740
I'm Ajay Abhaya Kumar.

01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:31.110
Nice to meet you.

01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:34.350
By the way, did you want
to meet me or my daughter?

01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:37.020
Well I'd have to impress you
first to stand a chance with her!

01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:39.960
We go back a long way.

01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:41.390
- Really?
- Yes.

01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:46.470
When I was little, my Dad took
me on his scooter every Sunday

01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:47.950
to meet my grandparents.

01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:49.710
And did I know your grandparents?

01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:50.920
No, hear me out.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.460
- That house of yours in Bangalore...
- Yes.

01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:54.620
It used to come en route.

01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:57.270
Whenever we crossed it,
Dad would say:

01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:58.590
"Do you know who lives here?"

01:25:58.670 --> 01:26:00.140
"The great Shakuntala Devi!"

01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:01.750
He would tell me:

01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:03.610
"Shakuntala Devi is from Bangalore."

01:26:03.690 --> 01:26:04.870
"And so are you."

01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:09.190
"The only difference is, she's always
out of the country thanks to Maths..."

01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:10.750
"And you're always out of class!"

01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:14.660
So? Did your Maths improve?

01:26:14.910 --> 01:26:15.640
No.

01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:20.310
I thought, India's already produced
this century's biggest Math Genius...

01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:21.890
Why should I even bother?

01:26:23.050 --> 01:26:24.550
Ajay Abhaya Kumar...

01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:25.990
I have an instinct.

01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:28.190
Your destiny's about to change.

01:26:28.390 --> 01:26:29.830
You're going to hit the jackpot!

01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:30.830
Thank you, ma'am.

01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:35.410
Since an astrologer like you is
saying it, I accept my fate humbly.

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:39.110
Maybe I should buy a
lottery ticket on my way back?

01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:43.590
Your glasses are empty.

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:45.190
Please allow me to refill them.

01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:46.460
Good idea!

01:26:48.050 --> 01:26:48.600
Thank you.

01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:49.450
No problem!

01:26:54.570 --> 01:26:57.100
Ajay Abhay Kumar...

01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:00.190
I should find out more about him.

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:01.920
Why? Plan on marrying him?

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.230
Yes. To you!

01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:06.960
My instinct says, this boy will be
my son-in-law some day.

01:27:07.670 --> 01:27:09.210
No, no, no!

01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:14.210
Ajay comes from
a very normal family.

01:27:14.290 --> 01:27:16.690
So I need all of
us to act normal too.

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:18.890
We promise you, Anu.

01:27:19.110 --> 01:27:21.940
We'll be so normal that
they won't even notice us.

01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:25.840
They'll be amazed
at how normal we are.

01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:29.040
I really love Ajay.

01:27:29.890 --> 01:27:32.670
When I'm with him, I feel complete.

01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:34.530
Like I've found my soulmate.

01:27:35.010 --> 01:27:36.780
Please don't mess this up today.

01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:40.310
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:43.450
And even if it isn't,
just have a baby with Ajay...

01:27:43.530 --> 01:27:45.770
Because he's so intelligent
and good looking!

01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:47.780
Shakuntala!

01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:50.030
Ma! Is this your idea of normal?

01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:02.440
Anu is a really normal girl!

01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:06.140
She was very normal at studies.

01:28:07.050 --> 01:28:09.880
Her career is super normal too!

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:14.860
You must try her cakes someday.
They're deliciously normal!

01:28:15.130 --> 01:28:15.920
Correct!

01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:22.890
Saying 'normal' every few seconds isn't
really normal behaviour, you know...

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:28.120
The weather's so hot, right?

01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:31.100
What's the cricket match score?

01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:32.960
There's no cricket match today.

01:28:34.050 --> 01:28:35.980
Your saree looks so pretty!

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:39.320
So much corruption
these days, right?

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:40.900
- Very bad...
- Very bad.

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.930
Why are we discussing all this...

01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:49.820
Isn't that what normal people
talk about?

01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:53.020
Thank God you aren't normal.

01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:56.380
Where else would we find
such entertaining in-laws!

01:28:59.950 --> 01:29:02.860
Have some sweets.
I made them myself.

01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:04.120
Really?

01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:06.660
I ordered them from
Sri Krishna Sweets.

01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:09.070
I was also just
pretending to be normal!

01:29:21.630 --> 01:29:23.350
I can't breathe...

01:29:23.630 --> 01:29:25.310
But you look classy!

01:29:27.170 --> 01:29:28.030
Come come...

01:29:28.110 --> 01:29:29.330
There are lots of options!

01:29:29.930 --> 01:29:31.370
Aunty, I don't really
wear formals...

01:29:32.250 --> 01:29:33.730
This will look good on you!

01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:34.720
Pandy!

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:35.300
Ma'am.

01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:35.810
Look.

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:39.730
Now he looks like
Shakuntala Devi's son-in-law!

01:29:39.810 --> 01:29:40.460
Correct!

01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:42.890
Pandy, here is my credit card.

01:29:42.970 --> 01:29:44.050
We're going to shop a lot.

01:29:44.130 --> 01:29:46.260
Aunty, please don't.
Please return the card.

01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:47.610
No... Why?

01:29:47.690 --> 01:29:48.880
Please return the card.

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:49.850
Pandy!

01:29:49.930 --> 01:29:50.610
Sorry, Sir.

01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:52.430
- Ajay!
- Aunty what are you doing!

01:29:52.510 --> 01:29:53.160
Please don't...

01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:54.950
It's a gift from me, keep it!

01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:58.490
I've never told you,
but I'm very rich.

01:29:58.570 --> 01:30:00.730
I just pretend to be middle-class!

01:30:00.810 --> 01:30:03.050
But Aunty, I really am middle-class.

01:30:03.790 --> 01:30:06.640
Well, once you move to
London with me after marriage...

01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:08.600
You won't remain
middle-class anymore.

01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:11.730
And I will take your
business to new heights.

01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:12.930
Wait and watch!

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:15.180
But I'm not shifting to London.

01:30:15.790 --> 01:30:19.330
Oh! But long distance
marriage is really difficult.

01:30:19.410 --> 01:30:20.500
Take it from me!

01:30:20.670 --> 01:30:22.740
But Anu's moving
to Bangalore, right?

01:30:23.550 --> 01:30:25.870
Anu's life is in London with me.

01:30:26.410 --> 01:30:28.690
But she'll be with
me after marriage.

01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:32.170
I can't live without Anu.

01:30:32.550 --> 01:30:33.990
But it's normal, Aunty.

01:30:34.370 --> 01:30:36.520
You can't jail your
daughter like this.

01:30:37.050 --> 01:30:37.880
'Normal'?

01:30:38.450 --> 01:30:40.660
When a boy's mother expects

01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:43.440
her daughter-in-law to
live with her, it's 'normal'.

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:46.040
But if a girl's mother expects

01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:49.130
her son-in-law to live with her,
she's jailing her?

01:30:49.210 --> 01:30:50.640
What logic is that, I say!

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.830
- Aunty I'm sorry, I didn't mean that...
- What did you mean?

01:30:57.020 --> 01:30:59.210
Anu won't live with
you or my parents.

01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:02.300
We've decided to live in
our own house after marriage.

01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:06.190
Anu will never leave
me and go to Bangalore.

01:31:06.330 --> 01:31:07.540
Why don't you ask her once...

01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:08.970
What she really wants?

01:31:10.420 --> 01:31:11.560
Aunty, she loves me...

01:31:12.450 --> 01:31:14.240
And I love her more than anything!

01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:15.250
Anyone.

01:31:17.290 --> 01:31:19.350
You love her more than anyone?

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.600
What have you done for her?

01:31:22.210 --> 01:31:23.730
Have you got this?

01:31:28.450 --> 01:31:31.410
You're not the world's
only mother to have a C-section!

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:34.790
He wants to snatch
you away from me, Anu!

01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:37.630
Moving with him is my own decision!

01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:42.510
But I've planned our
whole life ahead, Anu!

01:31:42.590 --> 01:31:44.930
And who gave you the
right to plan my life?

01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:46.830
I have dreams of my own too!

01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:48.650
And what about my dreams?

01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:53.700
You made me give up
my shows, astrology...

01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:56.080
I gave up Maths for you!

01:31:56.660 --> 01:31:59.110
I lost everything
so I could have you, Anu!

01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:00.370
I'm so sorry!

01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:04.300
You deserve the Nobel prize
for looking after your daughter!

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:11.630
Sorry. Sorry Anu.

01:32:16.830 --> 01:32:17.650
Anu...

01:32:23.250 --> 01:32:24.110
So...

01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:29.000
What about your business in London?

01:32:31.010 --> 01:32:32.250
I can run it from here.

01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:37.770
If you leave me for that boy...

01:32:39.970 --> 01:32:42.240
You can say goodbye
to your business too.

01:32:49.690 --> 01:32:52.320
You already separated me from Dad...

01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:55.700
I won't let you
take my love away now!

01:32:56.450 --> 01:32:58.370
And if that means
losing the business

01:32:58.450 --> 01:33:01.310
I built with my own hard work...

01:33:01.390 --> 01:33:02.380
So be it!

01:33:05.550 --> 01:33:09.100
That fellow is feeding you rubbish,
I'm telling you Anu!

01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:10.970
What are you doing?

01:33:11.050 --> 01:33:12.160
Anu, just listen to...

01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:14.150
What are you doing?

01:33:14.230 --> 01:33:15.740
Anu. Anu!

01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:17.270
Where are you going?

01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:18.000
Anu!

01:33:18.770 --> 01:33:19.770
Anu, let's...

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:21.060
Anu!

01:33:25.050 --> 01:33:25.860
Anu!

01:33:36.030 --> 01:33:37.910
You are right Shakuntala, but...

01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:39.890
Yes, but...

01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:42.670
That's true, but...

01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:45.960
Right.

01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:55.560
Come what may...

01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:58.020
I'm going to marry Ajay.

01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:01.930
Now you decide, Dad...

01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:04.050
If you're on my side...

01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:05.020
Or Ma's.

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:17.120
This is Anu Banerji.

01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:20.160
I'm sorry I can't take your call
right now, please leave your number-

01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:58.670
Ladies and Gentlemen...

01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:01.460
Welcome to The Mohan Manhas Show!

01:35:01.730 --> 01:35:05.020
Where we crack jokes
with famous folks!

01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:09.370
Our special guest today calls
herself the 'Human Computer'.

01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:12.270
I call myself Shakuntala.

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:14.820
People call me the Human Computer.

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:20.080
So Ms. Devi, we hear you're
doing very few shows of late...

01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:21.900
Planning to retire?

01:35:22.350 --> 01:35:23.900
Why would I retire...

01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:27.640
When I can set a stage on fire!

01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:32.020
Ooh! Your sense of
humour is surely intact!

01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:33.220
So tell us...

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:37.480
Have your Maths skills
reduced with age?

01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:41.080
Age is just a number.
And numbers love me!

01:35:41.470 --> 01:35:43.900
And may I ask... How old are you?

01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:48.160
- If you don't mind...
- No, no I don't mind.

01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:52.310
I'm a day older than yesterday...

01:35:52.570 --> 01:35:55.200
And a day younger than tomorrow.

01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:56.410
Now you do the Math!

01:35:57.800 --> 01:35:59.780
Well played, well played!

01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:01.930
Okay then, let's keep playing.

01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:05.350
We also have some
Math problems for you.

01:36:06.910 --> 01:36:09.520
I thought this was just a talk show.

01:36:09.690 --> 01:36:12.260
Wherever you go,
Maths follows. Right?

01:36:13.330 --> 01:36:14.350
Starting easy.

01:36:14.650 --> 01:36:16.980
What's the cube of 121.

01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:24.560
1761561.

01:36:28.730 --> 01:36:35.260
Sorry, I meant 1771561

01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:38.700
which is also the 4th power of 11.

01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:42.760
Ms. Devi, if my
calculations are right...

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:45.410
I think you mean
the sixth power of 11?

01:36:46.350 --> 01:36:47.620
You are correct.

01:36:48.090 --> 01:36:50.410
You're in the Guinness
Book of World Records...

01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:53.990
So our next question should
be a piece of cake for you...

01:36:54.410 --> 01:36:55.470
On your screen!

01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:04.060
Ms. Devi?

01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:26.120
I'm sorry... My head hurts.

01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:31.960
I haven't slept well
the last few nights...

01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:35.070
Can I get a two minute break please?

01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:36.630
Of course.

01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:39.950
Looks like the 'Human computer'
finally crashed today!

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:41.700
Don't go anywhere.

01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:45.140
We'll be right back after a short break
with The Mohan Manhas Show!

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:55.930
Stop here.
The car can't go any further.

01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:29.880
Shakuntala, you need to practice.

01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:32.550
You're booked for
ten shows next week.

01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:35.490
What goes around comes around.

01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:37.910
Wait till your daughter
gives you a hard time!

01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:42.000
You'll be a big man someday.

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:43.690
Why would I be a man?

01:39:43.930 --> 01:39:48.620
Because there's no such
thing as a 'big woman'!

01:39:49.610 --> 01:39:52.230
In that case,
I'll definitely be a big woman.

01:39:53.310 --> 01:39:54.720
- God-promise?
- God- promise.

01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:53.360
Amma, I'm talking to you!
Have you lost your voice?

01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:56.180
Why can't you speak
up in front of him?

01:41:00.490 --> 01:41:01.810
Amma!

01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:52.150
Hello.

01:41:53.390 --> 01:41:54.030
Vasanti?

01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:56.420
I want to speak to my lawyer.

01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:13.560
- Hi! Thanks a lot for coming.
- Thank you.

01:42:14.890 --> 01:42:16.100
Hello. Thanks for coming.

01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:17.640
Let me know what
you think of the house.

01:42:18.030 --> 01:42:20.630
Hi! Please see all the rooms
and tell me what you think.

01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:21.660
Thank you so much.

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:24.090
- Hi!
- Anu!

01:42:25.330 --> 01:42:26.490
It's been so long.

01:42:26.630 --> 01:42:27.460
Congratulations!

01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:30.290
Thank you so much!
It's a dream come true.

01:42:30.370 --> 01:42:32.700
I've refurbished four houses.
I hope we find good buyers now.

01:42:32.850 --> 01:42:33.960
We've invested a lot!

01:42:34.170 --> 01:42:36.390
- We were congratulating you about Amritha!
- Exactly!

01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:37.770
Thank you.

01:42:38.020 --> 01:42:40.080
- She's also a dream come true for me.
- 'Also'?

01:42:40.250 --> 01:42:43.130
Anu, you're a mother now.
You should just have one dream now.

01:42:43.210 --> 01:42:44.250
Exactly.
But where is she?

01:42:44.330 --> 01:42:46.130
We still haven't met her.
How old is she now?

01:42:46.210 --> 01:42:47.430
She's very young right now.

01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:49.300
And I was so busy with work, that...

01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:50.380
Busy, really?

01:42:50.830 --> 01:42:53.060
This is the time for
you to enjoy her childhood.

01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:54.800
These days won't ever come back!

01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:58.870
You know Anu, I took a maternity
break from my job for my first baby.

01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:01.290
And before I knew it,
I had another child.

01:43:01.370 --> 01:43:03.690
Then I thought, 'Let it go.
I can always pick up a job later.'

01:43:03.770 --> 01:43:04.790
My children needed me.

01:43:05.090 --> 01:43:06.730
And I don't think
of this as sacrifice.

01:43:07.530 --> 01:43:08.420
It's my duty!

01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:12.350
Absolutely, it's never a sacrifice.

01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:15.500
Please eat something.

01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:16.940
I'll just go check on things.

01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:19.910
- Hey, nice house!
-Thanks.

01:43:24.290 --> 01:43:26.090
Anu. You killed it!

01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:28.200
Everyone's full of praise for you.

01:43:28.410 --> 01:43:29.720
- I'm going home.
- Why?

01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:31.790
We're both here,
and Amritha's there alone...

01:43:31.870 --> 01:43:33.050
It's okay! Her nanny's there.

01:43:33.130 --> 01:43:34.480
But her mom isn't.

01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:36.030
I'm leaving, you handle the rest.

01:43:36.110 --> 01:43:37.130
Listen!

01:43:37.330 --> 01:43:39.310
- Excuse me.
- Yeah sure.

01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:44.150
Anu.

01:43:44.730 --> 01:43:46.180
She's fast asleep.

01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:48.090
I need to talk to you.

01:43:48.870 --> 01:43:50.510
I need to tell you something first.

01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:51.530
Okay.

01:43:57.230 --> 01:43:58.120
You know, Ajay...

01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:00.960
Maybe I was too harsh on Ma.

01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:06.290
She calls me everyday
and I've never answered.

01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:10.290
I've decided...

01:44:10.650 --> 01:44:12.990
I'm going to call Ma
and tell her about Amritha.

01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:18.110
First see what she's done.

01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:32.370
Your mother has used her power of
attorney and sold all your properties.

01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:35.700
My business properties in London?

01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:36.960
Yes.

01:44:38.890 --> 01:44:40.770
And what about my profit share?

01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:42.000
Zero. Nothing.

01:44:42.210 --> 01:44:43.090
Absolutely zilch.

01:44:43.730 --> 01:44:46.430
In fact the capital gains tax
liability is completely on your name.

01:44:46.510 --> 01:44:48.250
Which means you will have to pay it.

01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:50.490
We'll have to pay it.

01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:54.570
How much?

01:44:57.910 --> 01:45:00.890
So much that even if we sell
our house and both our businesses...

01:45:01.750 --> 01:45:03.090
We still won't be
able to pay it off, Anu.

01:45:04.450 --> 01:45:06.080
Your mother has finished us.

01:45:07.340 --> 01:45:08.460
We're finished!

01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.780
Now what?

01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:14.850
We have two options.

01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:19.360
Either we sell everything we have,
borrow money from friends...

01:45:20.110 --> 01:45:23.860
Take a bank loan and
get rid of this liability.

01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:27.690
I'll take the other option.

01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:33.650
The other option is legal.

01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:36.790
We'll have to go to London and file
a court case against your mother.

01:45:38.090 --> 01:45:38.990
A criminal case.

01:45:40.060 --> 01:45:41.310
She could go to jail.

01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:44.060
She wanted to fight.

01:45:44.530 --> 01:45:45.970
Now she'll have to fight a war.

01:45:52.010 --> 01:45:54.090
You need to be strong and brutal.

01:45:54.450 --> 01:45:56.320
Don't get carried
away by any emotions.

01:45:56.530 --> 01:45:57.650
We will win this.

01:45:59.370 --> 01:46:01.130
Yes. Yes, we will.

01:46:03.850 --> 01:46:04.990
Hello everyone.

01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:15.740
Ms. Banerji, If you could
take a seat, please?

01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:17.250
Anu.

01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:36.550
Let's begin.

01:46:37.190 --> 01:46:38.950
My client Ms. Anupama
Banerji would like to...

01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:40.740
press criminal charges
against her mother...

01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:43.350
for unlawfully selling her properties
that were in both their names...

01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:45.910
and sending the tax bill
to an unsuspecting Ms. Banerji.

01:46:46.350 --> 01:46:49.760
My client Shakuntala Devi
vehemently denies this charge.

01:46:50.230 --> 01:46:53.680
It was her money that Anupama
Banerji used to build this business.

01:46:54.020 --> 01:46:56.200
And Ms. Banerji did
not repay a penny of it.

01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:58.800
So this justifies
the tax bill completely.

01:46:59.140 --> 01:47:01.480
Shakuntala Devi
is an unfit mother...

01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:05.020
who chased her ambitions at the
cost of raising her own daughter.

01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:06.460
That's a false accusation.

01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:08.820
Did she not take
Anu out of the country?

01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:12.990
Did you not stop her from
going to school with other children?

01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:16.210
She took her out of the country
from show to show, hotel to hotel...

01:47:16.290 --> 01:47:17.990
Depriving her of any childhood.

01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:20.610
Did she not keep Anu away
from her father for ten years?

01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:22.170
Ten years!

01:47:22.250 --> 01:47:26.210
And not even one letter was passed
on from her beloved father...

01:47:26.860 --> 01:47:30.720
And did she not accuse her
father of being a homosexual...

01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:32.160
At a public gathering!

01:47:32.450 --> 01:47:33.150
Correct.

01:47:38.610 --> 01:47:39.660
I'm sorry...

01:47:40.170 --> 01:47:40.710
What?

01:47:41.770 --> 01:47:44.110
I accept all your accusations.

01:47:46.530 --> 01:47:48.840
Your lawyer is absolutely right.

01:47:51.460 --> 01:47:52.960
I'm a terrible mother.

01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:07.820
We made a profit of one million, one
thousand and one pounds exactly...

01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:09.860
After selling the
properties, correct?

01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:11.130
Yes, that's right.

01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:16.050
What a beautiful number.

01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:18.900
It's called a palindrome.

01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:23.630
Meaning, it reads the
same frontwards and backwards.

01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:36.320
I want to sign a cheque and give my
daughter the entire amount right now.

01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:41.170
Ms. Devi, that's preposterous.

01:48:41.420 --> 01:48:45.450
Anu if you want to press criminal
charges and send me to jail...

01:48:47.630 --> 01:48:51.870
God-promise,
I'm ready to go to jail.

01:48:53.310 --> 01:48:56.990
Ms. Devi, you can't just
lose this case like this.

01:48:58.870 --> 01:49:01.370
I never lose, Mr Stevens...

01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:03.530
I always win.

01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:09.940
I just wanted to see
you once anyhow, Anu.

01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:12.340
I've seen you now.

01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:15.460
That's enough.

01:49:17.630 --> 01:49:20.410
Who does all this
for such a small thing?

01:49:21.730 --> 01:49:23.190
My Drama-Queen mother!

01:49:24.850 --> 01:49:29.540
Do you have any idea
of the impact of your actions?

01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:32.380
Don't you ever get tired?

01:49:32.590 --> 01:49:38.710
Anu, I spent my...

01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:43.110
entire life hating my mother...

01:49:44.350 --> 01:49:48.510
I didn't want you
to hate me like that...

01:49:50.340 --> 01:49:51.430
Anu...

01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:53.440
Anu!

01:49:54.650 --> 01:49:59.090
Ms. Devi, please.
We have to talk through this.

01:49:59.670 --> 01:50:00.640
Can we step out?

01:50:01.260 --> 01:50:03.100
Yes that would be a good idea.

01:50:03.330 --> 01:50:04.720
Let's all take a small break.

01:50:08.670 --> 01:50:11.280
I need to be alone.

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:14.560
Okay. I'll be right outside
if you need me, okay?

01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:22.900
Ajay!

01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:28.460
Ajay!

01:51:29.590 --> 01:51:30.360
You okay?

01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:35.300
I always used to ridicule
her Black-Book...

01:51:35.630 --> 01:51:39.210
But see...
She actually made one for me!

01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:44.320
This is me with the Prime
Minister of Mauritius...

01:51:44.650 --> 01:51:46.710
With the President of Kenya...

01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:48.540
This is in Canada...

01:51:48.970 --> 01:51:52.030
And look, that's me
with Amitabh Bachchan!

01:51:53.930 --> 01:51:57.270
Whenever Ma met a film star,
she'd tell them-

01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:00.330
"My daughter's your biggest fan!"

01:52:00.730 --> 01:52:02.890
And then they would go-

01:52:02.970 --> 01:52:05.740
"Really?
Which one's your favourite film?"

01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:07.950
And I would just freeze.

01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:10.190
I had no clue who they were.

01:52:11.010 --> 01:52:13.190
And Ma would burst out laughing!

01:52:24.190 --> 01:52:27.870
I always thought I had
such a terrible childhood...

01:52:29.290 --> 01:52:31.770
Then why am I smiling
in all these pictures?

01:52:37.710 --> 01:52:42.400
I always thought
you and I are one team.

01:52:43.450 --> 01:52:45.460
That we belong to each other.

01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:49.690
But when I saw the two
of you together today...

01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:52.310
I realised...

01:52:53.650 --> 01:52:55.470
Your team has changed, Anu.

01:52:58.260 --> 01:53:00.130
I can't fight with you anymore, Ma.

01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:05.170
Anu, I'm sorry.

01:53:06.190 --> 01:53:08.650
I couldn't be the mother you wanted.

01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:11.460
I wasn't exactly
a model daughter either!

01:53:11.540 --> 01:53:13.530
You had to quit Maths because of me.

01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:16.050
When you left,
Maths left me too, Anu...

01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:18.670
I'm sorry, Ma...

01:53:20.090 --> 01:53:22.320
I always saw you as a mother.

01:53:22.730 --> 01:53:24.250
Never as a woman.

01:53:26.210 --> 01:53:29.710
Now that I have my own daughter,
I understand...

01:53:29.790 --> 01:53:32.260
What? Am I already
old enough to be a grandma?

01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:33.900
Are you happy or sad!

01:53:34.750 --> 01:53:37.660
I've never been happier
in my whole life!

01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:43.760
My baby.

01:53:51.180 --> 01:53:52.490
Mothers and daughters...

01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:55.160
What a waste of a day!

01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:57.440
Mothers and daughters!

01:53:59.430 --> 01:54:00.610
Mothers and daughters...

01:54:04.490 --> 01:54:05.680
Amritha!

01:54:05.950 --> 01:54:09.160
How could you name her
Amritha without asking me?

01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:11.750
It's okay, gentlemen.

01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:13.520
But my instinct says...

01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:17.470
You'll have another daughter,
and she'll be called Nayana!

01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:20.980
Excuse me.

01:54:21.740 --> 01:54:22.610
I'll be outside.

01:54:22.690 --> 01:54:23.530
Take your time.

01:54:27.010 --> 01:54:29.870
By the way,
Ajay's not so bad after all.

01:54:31.380 --> 01:54:32.220
Thanks Ma!

01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:35.340
He reminds me of Paritosh.

01:54:36.650 --> 01:54:42.570
But living in one city,
with one man, forever...

01:54:42.650 --> 01:54:43.890
What kind of life is that?

01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:45.920
Don't say 'normal'!

01:55:02.830 --> 01:55:05.570
The genius...
Guinness Book record-holding

01:55:05.650 --> 01:55:07.420
world-famous Mathematician...

01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:09.080
The Human Computer!

01:55:09.490 --> 01:55:12.590
Shakuntala Devi Ma'am,
it is my absolute honour...

01:55:12.670 --> 01:55:15.910
to give away the prestigious Mathematics
Lifetime Achievement Award to you.

01:55:21.550 --> 01:55:22.180
Oh please!

01:55:23.170 --> 01:55:25.260
I am younger than you in mind!

01:55:27.380 --> 01:55:31.240
Shakuntala Ma'am, we can't let you
go without saying a couple of words.

01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:35.620
A couple?

01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:37.090
'Thank you.'
Can I leave now?

01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:41.840
Please, no.

01:55:42.150 --> 01:55:43.790
- Can you keep it there please?
- Yes.

01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:44.860
Thank you.

01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:51.120
Zero is my favorite number.

01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:54.540
Maybe because this world is round?

01:55:56.730 --> 01:56:00.430
Sometimes life teaches us lessons...

01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:02.570
By making us spin in circles!

01:56:09.250 --> 01:56:12.200
Today, I want to say something...

01:56:14.150 --> 01:56:18.090
That I haven't even
said to myself before.

01:56:21.110 --> 01:56:26.240
All my life,
I was angry with my mother.

01:56:27.020 --> 01:56:31.040
And I didn't realize
when anger turned into hate.

01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:38.440
I was angry that she never
spoke up in front of my father.

01:56:39.670 --> 01:56:42.340
Because she didn't
have a voice of her own.

01:56:45.010 --> 01:56:47.030
Maybe that's why today...

01:56:48.210 --> 01:56:50.050
...I have my own voice.

01:56:53.150 --> 01:56:56.810
It was only when my daughter
explained it to me, that I realised...

01:56:57.100 --> 01:57:02.290
I always saw my mother
just as a mother...

01:57:04.930 --> 01:57:07.120
And never as a woman.

01:57:08.330 --> 01:57:09.850
I never understood her.

01:57:10.890 --> 01:57:13.720
My only ambition in life...

01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:18.430
Was to not become like my mother.

01:57:21.070 --> 01:57:25.200
And so perhaps
everything I am today...

01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:27.670
Is because of her.

01:57:30.990 --> 01:57:31.760
Ma!

01:57:32.900 --> 01:57:34.350
I'm proud of you!

01:57:40.060 --> 01:57:41.780
I am also who I am

01:57:43.090 --> 01:57:44.480
because of my daughter.

01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:51.180
My darling Anu, who is whistling
from the audience for me.

01:57:53.470 --> 01:57:57.400
Her whistles and the pride
I see in her eyes today...

01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:00.590
Is my biggest award.

01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:11.570
Every mom hopes that her daughter
won't just see her as a mother...

01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:16.290
But also as a genius sometimes.

01:58:25.950 --> 01:58:27.480
Okay, I've rambled on enough...

01:58:28.230 --> 01:58:29.640
Shall we do some Maths?

01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:31.030
Yes...

01:58:31.950 --> 01:58:33.730
Is everyone low on energy?

01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:35.210
I can't hear you yet!

01:58:35.450 --> 01:58:37.000
Yes!

01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:43.120
Okay so today, I am going to introduce
you to 'Miss Revolving Number'.

01:58:46.050 --> 01:58:47.140
She's very special.

01:58:47.570 --> 01:58:48.670
I'll tell you why!

01:58:49.310 --> 01:58:51.550
142857...

01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:09.180
That's my mother.

01:59:10.150 --> 01:59:12.390
My amazing mother!

01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:21.830
Our relationship wasn't
built on reverence or sacrifice.

01:59:26.030 --> 01:59:30.650
She wasn't the typical mom
who exists in books and films...

01:59:32.890 --> 01:59:37.220
Because my mother knew
how to live for herself.

01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:40.960
She knew how to value herself.

01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:49.200
She knew how to embrace
life wholeheartedly.

01:59:57.600 --> 02:00:02.090
Everyday, I strive to
be a little like her.

02:00:06.630 --> 02:00:07.960
God-promise.

02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:49.980
BODMAS.

02:02:50.170 --> 02:02:53.080
B for Bracket.

02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:56.270
O for Order.

02:02:56.970 --> 02:02:59.520
D for Division.

02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:02.400
M for Multiplication.

02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:05.530
A for Addition.

02:03:05.790 --> 02:03:08.570
S for Subtraction.

02:03:20.750 --> 02:03:23.000
Two chickens each for you and me

02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:25.040
Make four chickens in all

02:03:25.450 --> 02:03:27.830
Seven notes on the count of three

02:03:27.910 --> 02:03:29.910
Put the melody in a song

02:03:30.330 --> 02:03:32.580
Numbers make the world go round

02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:35.000
Step out of the box and see

02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:37.370
Why become a bookworm...

02:03:37.450 --> 02:03:39.160
Set your mind free

02:03:39.330 --> 02:03:40.040
Sing with me

02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:42.250
1,2,3,4...

02:03:42.330 --> 02:03:49.250
There's no pass, there's no fail

02:03:49.330 --> 02:03:50.950
Be fearless, all is well

02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:51.950
Sing with me!

02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:54.250
There's no pass, there's no fail

02:03:54.330 --> 02:03:56.370
It's a classroom not a jail

02:03:56.450 --> 02:03:58.790
There's no pass, there's no fail

02:03:58.870 --> 02:04:01.160
Set your mind free

02:04:08.330 --> 02:04:10.500
Be fearless and sing with me

02:04:10.580 --> 02:04:11.550
Sing with me!

02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:20.400
Be fearless and sing with me

02:04:30.260 --> 02:04:32.590
It's easier than it seems

02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:34.970
No reason to lose your mind

02:04:35.050 --> 02:04:37.390
Just take on what it brings

02:04:37.470 --> 02:04:39.640
Kick your fears behind

02:04:39.970 --> 02:04:42.340
Why let books weigh you down

02:04:42.430 --> 02:04:44.470
It's time to let them go

02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:46.970
You're light as a whiff of air

02:04:47.050 --> 02:04:48.890
So take flight and soar!

02:04:48.970 --> 02:04:51.760
Sing with me
1,2,3,4...

02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:58.760
There's no pass, there's no fail

02:04:58.840 --> 02:05:00.800
Be fearless, all is well

02:05:00.890 --> 02:05:01.720
Sing with me!

02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:03.640
There's no pass, there's no fail

02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:06.000
It's a classroom not a jail

02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:08.350
There's no pass, there's no fail

02:05:08.430 --> 02:05:11.060
Set your mind free

02:05:17.990 --> 02:05:20.100
Be fearless, all is well

02:05:20.180 --> 02:05:21.520
Sing with me!
