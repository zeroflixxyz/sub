00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.549
Did you see what's happening?

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:26.664
Come on, come on, let's go!

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.420
Hey, what's going on?

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:44.701
In there. It's on the news.

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.590
<i>Then, 18 minutes later,</i>

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.265
<i>a second one went into
the other twin tower.</i>

00:01:57.339 --> 00:02:01.264
<i>Can you paint us a picture
of the situation in New York...</i>

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:04.388
<i>An everyday morning situation,
presumably pretty busy in the streets,</i>

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:05.625
<i>people going about their business.</i>

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:08.020
<i>Well, it's a beautiful day
here in New York.</i>

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.500
<i>Everyone is out in the street,
everyone's on their rooftops,</i>

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:12.627
<i>everyone's on their mobile phones.</i>

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:15.384
<i>I don't think people can quite
believe what's happened.</i>

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.143
<i>Given that this is the financial district,</i>

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:18.306
<i>is it your understanding that people...</i>

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.143
You're American, aren't you?
Sorry, mate.

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:21.459
<i>...may actually be inside
the World Trade Center?</i>

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:22.950
<i>I mean, without a shadow of a doubt</i>

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.505
<i>there will be people in there.
They get to work very early.</i>

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.150
<i>And what about
the emergency services?</i>

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:32.460
<i>I, John Patrick Ryan,</i>

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:35.019
<i>do solemnly swear that
I will support and defend</i>

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.306
<i>the Constitution of the United States</i>

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.507
<i>against all enemies,
foreign and domestic,</i>

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.344
<i>that I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same</i>

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:46.347
<i>and that I will obey the orders
of the President of the United States</i>

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:49.104
<i>and the orders of the officers
appointed over me</i>

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:52.422
<i>according to regulations and the
Uniform Code of Military Justice,</i>

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:54.183
<i>so help me, God.</i>

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:55.590
- Come on, then!
- I got one!

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.388
- Let's hear it!
- Richmond Webb.

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:58.460
You serious?

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:00.382
My man was a seven-time Pro Bowler.

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.904
I'm just saying Brown's better.

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:03.743
Man, how come every cat
from Baltimore

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.981
always got to bring up Orlando Brown?

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.850
Because Brown's the most underrated
offensive tackle in the business.

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.748
- Have you ever seen him play?
- What? Aw, man.

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.109
Yes, this is Lieutenant Ryan.

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:16.227
Yes, sir, I did. I was wondering

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.020
if you had a chance to forward
my report on the Saabir Khan Bridge

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.022
to anyone in intel.

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.706
Yes, sir, they are the same findings
I already reported.

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:29.864
I just can't help noticing a correlation
between traffic patterns there

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:31.100
and the region's other...

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.708
Well, if they do respond,

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:37.908
I would be happy to explain it to
whoever's in charge of regional...

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:39.819
Sir?

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:43.227
Still no love from the C.O.?

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.700
I don't get it. I'm just trying to help.

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:47.383
Hey, guys. Buckle up in the back.

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.700
We're running into a little turbulence.

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:50.826
You all right there, Private?

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:52.389
- Sir, yes, sir!
- Good man!

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.429
Man, I still don't get
why you requested this detail.

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:58.150
Big brain like yours, man, why aren't you
behind some desk somewhere?

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:59.630
You requested this?

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.867
I just figured if I was gonna serve,
I should serve.

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.670
Man, that's some patriotic shit right there,
you see that?

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.310
You're all right, Lieutenant.
Even if your team is wack.

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.780
Oh, stop talking trash
on my Ravens, homeboy.

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:12.543
I'm a Bengals fan.

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:13.859
The Bengals?

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.663
Rookie, get that harness on
and stop trying to be down.

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.901
Man, you got a lot to learn, Davies.

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.789
Left in, right twist, click.

00:04:22.859 --> 00:04:24.020
Thank you, sir!

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:31.825
You want some help?

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:49.780
Move, move, move!

00:04:49.859 --> 00:04:51.543
Chopper crash.
Spinal cord should be okay,

00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:53.906
but he's got two shattered vertebrae
and no feeling in his legs.

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.060
Lieutenant Ryan!

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:58.065
Lieutenant Ryan!
Did anyone else make it out alive?

00:04:58.419 --> 00:04:59.944
Yeah, two.
Ryan dragged them both out.

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.669
With a broken back?

00:05:01.739 --> 00:05:03.980
Okay, we're gonna have a look at you
and it's gonna hurt, okay?

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:05.629
X-rays are on the board.

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:06.825
Okay, turn him!

00:05:12.299 --> 00:05:13.380
Okay, clear him!

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:15.427
Down on three. One, two, three.

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:16.625
Can't do anything from here.

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:18.747
Evac him to NATO trauma
in Kandahar right now.

00:05:18.859 --> 00:05:21.385
Get an ear out to Dr. Hardesty.
Tell him to prep for a foraminotomy

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:23.268
or possible spondylolisthesis.

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:25.540
We've got spinal compression
and root damage at minimum.

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:27.946
Lieutenant has about a 90-minute window
if he wants to walk again.

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:29.066
Okay, move, move!

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:30.425
Let's go. Come on, come on!

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:31.739
Out of the way! Out of the way!

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:33.709
That guy's done in this war.

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:48.225
Gently.

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.579
Push more to the next level.

00:05:55.579 --> 00:05:56.740
Good.

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:00.302
That's really good, Jack.

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:05.584
Come on. You can do this.

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:06.820
Get up.

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:08.822
I don't like you very much, Doctor.

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:11.821
I'm not a doctor.
I'm a 3rd-year med student

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:15.267
who is four credits short in P.T.
until you decide to walk.

00:06:15.859 --> 00:06:17.623
You're sick. You're a sadist.

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:21.949
Come on, meet me halfway.

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:28.304
Give me two Percocet.

00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:31.427
Get up and I'll ask them for one.

00:06:43.859 --> 00:06:45.304
How long's he been here?

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:46.744
Eight months.

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:49.950
Think he'll ever walk
without the crutches?

00:06:50.859 --> 00:06:51.985
Maybe.

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:55.143
If he decides he has somewhere to go.

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:10.542
I'd like to talk to him.

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:12.424
Sure.

00:07:12.859 --> 00:07:14.190
Not yet.

00:07:16.179 --> 00:07:17.669
But soon.

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:23.184
Will you do me a favor and wait
two minutes before you take that?

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:25.420
Why?

00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:27.942
So that you know you can.

00:07:54.179 --> 00:07:56.227
- Lieutenant Ryan?
- Yes, sir?

00:07:56.299 --> 00:07:57.505
Please, at ease.

00:07:57.579 --> 00:08:00.025
Commander Thomas Harper, U.S. Navy.

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:04.428
Why the uniform today?

00:08:05.059 --> 00:08:06.424
I beg your pardon?

00:08:06.499 --> 00:08:09.628
I mean, you were wearing a suit and tie
the last time you were here.

00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:11.906
You watched me from
behind the glass in rehab.

00:08:12.339 --> 00:08:13.943
What can I do for you, Commander?

00:08:14.339 --> 00:08:15.829
You've already done it.

00:08:15.899 --> 00:08:18.584
I just want to say thank you
for your service.

00:08:19.099 --> 00:08:20.225
I appreciate that.

00:08:20.539 --> 00:08:21.904
John P. Ryan, right?

00:08:22.939 --> 00:08:23.986
That's right.

00:08:24.099 --> 00:08:27.069
The one who wrote Liquidity Events
in Post-Soviet Markets?

00:08:28.579 --> 00:08:31.867
Two-thirds of it, yes.
My... My dissertation.

00:08:31.939 --> 00:08:34.670
The same John P. Ryan
who filed three separate reports

00:08:34.739 --> 00:08:37.902
on traffic patterns in and around
the Saabir Khan Bridge?

00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:39.589
Yes, sir.

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:41.263
It's impressive work.

00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:48.179
How did you get a hold of that, sir?

00:08:51.779 --> 00:08:53.747
I'm in the CIA.

00:09:04.979 --> 00:09:06.060
Jack?

00:09:06.699 --> 00:09:07.860
Oh, hey.

00:09:11.859 --> 00:09:15.750
So, this is... This is good-bye.

00:09:16.099 --> 00:09:17.942
I'm glad I found you.

00:09:19.619 --> 00:09:21.269
No more P.T. work for you?

00:09:21.659 --> 00:09:24.139
No, just eye-doctoring.

00:09:25.619 --> 00:09:27.030
Congratulations.

00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:31.981
I'm hungry. You wanna buy me dinner?

00:09:33.979 --> 00:09:35.060
You know I can't.

00:09:35.139 --> 00:09:37.426
All right, you win. I'll buy.

00:09:38.499 --> 00:09:40.183
I'll make you a deal.

00:09:40.259 --> 00:09:42.466
The day you run all the way out of here,

00:09:42.579 --> 00:09:43.740
we'll have dinner.

00:09:44.499 --> 00:09:46.103
And split the check.

00:09:49.139 --> 00:09:50.140
See ya.

00:09:50.499 --> 00:09:51.546
See ya.

00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:01.980
Good luck.

00:10:30.139 --> 00:10:33.029
Jesus, you weren't kidding.
You are in the CIA.

00:10:33.579 --> 00:10:35.468
Somebody has to be.

00:10:37.739 --> 00:10:39.901
Why didn't you finish your Ph.D.?

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:43.229
- I joined the Marines.
- And saved two of your men.

00:10:43.859 --> 00:10:46.180
You handled yourself like a hero.

00:10:50.899 --> 00:10:53.140
If you still want to serve your country,

00:10:53.659 --> 00:10:55.388
there's another way.

00:10:56.059 --> 00:10:57.663
You're not really in the CIA, are you?

00:11:00.019 --> 00:11:02.943
What are you? Treasury?
Foreign Asset Control?

00:11:05.659 --> 00:11:08.902
You know, I'm not supposed to tell
anybody what I do for a living.

00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:11.863
And now, look, I've just told you twice.

00:11:12.379 --> 00:11:13.904
What do you want from me?

00:11:14.739 --> 00:11:16.887
I want to send you
back to school to finish your doctorate.

00:11:17.019 --> 00:11:19.670
Then you'll join Financial Intelligence
as an analyst.

00:11:19.739 --> 00:11:21.821
You'll work in a series of
private banks on Wall Street,

00:11:21.899 --> 00:11:25.267
where you'll use your position
to uncover funding for terror groups.

00:11:26.099 --> 00:11:27.100
Covertly.

00:11:27.259 --> 00:11:30.422
Yep. So you have to
keep it to yourself.

00:11:31.099 --> 00:11:33.386
Your employers
won't know you work for us.

00:11:33.459 --> 00:11:36.224
The people you
love won't know you do, either.

00:11:36.299 --> 00:11:37.949
It's gonna get lonely,

00:11:38.299 --> 00:11:40.267
but it's how we like to do things.

00:11:40.859 --> 00:11:43.988
You know, people don't like you guys
very much these days.

00:11:44.859 --> 00:11:46.623
Waterboarding. Rendition.

00:11:46.739 --> 00:11:47.979
Not my unit.

00:11:48.259 --> 00:11:49.420
Come on.
You can do better than that.

00:11:49.539 --> 00:11:50.700
I can.

00:11:51.179 --> 00:11:53.580
And I do.
And so do the people in my unit.

00:11:53.659 --> 00:11:55.149
Which unit is that?

00:11:56.499 --> 00:11:59.389
The one that
makes sure we don't get hit again.

00:12:34.979 --> 00:12:36.026
I knew.

00:12:36.099 --> 00:12:38.386
I knew when you saw me ride it,
you'd want one.

00:12:40.699 --> 00:12:42.667
- Nice.
- Yeah.

00:12:42.899 --> 00:12:44.264
Oh, her name's Sarah, by the way.

00:12:44.339 --> 00:12:45.306
Who?

00:12:45.379 --> 00:12:47.222
The one you like in Arbitrage.

00:12:47.299 --> 00:12:48.266
How'd you know that?

00:12:48.339 --> 00:12:51.183
Why else would anybody
buy a motorcycle?

00:12:51.499 --> 00:12:53.422
- Teddy Hefferman?
- Sarah, yes.

00:12:53.499 --> 00:12:56.423
Jack Ryan said you could help me
with the Balfour arbitrage.

00:12:56.499 --> 00:12:57.546
- How're you doing?
- Hi.

00:12:58.739 --> 00:13:00.184
What do you have?

00:13:01.259 --> 00:13:02.943
This looks good.

00:13:05.219 --> 00:13:06.744
<i>The World Bank urging caution</i>

00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:10.187
<i>as volatilities in emerging markets
continue to remind investors</i>

00:13:10.259 --> 00:13:12.739
<i>that with unprecedented
global interconnectivity,</i>

00:13:12.859 --> 00:13:16.102
<i>even the strongest economies
are vulnerable to collapse.</i>

00:13:16.179 --> 00:13:17.226
<i>This just in.</i>

00:13:17.579 --> 00:13:19.866
<i>Last minute negotiations
are expected today</i>

00:13:19.939 --> 00:13:22.704
<i>as the security council of
the United Nations votes.</i>

00:13:23.139 --> 00:13:26.109
<i>Russia's bitterly opposed
to a new Turkish pipeline,</i>

00:13:26.219 --> 00:13:30.269
<i>which could see Russian economic
dominance of oil exports shattered.</i>

00:13:30.379 --> 00:13:33.701
<i>The big question,
will the U.S. defy Russia?</i>

00:13:39.579 --> 00:13:42.708
The only thing that
the Turks and the Georgians

00:13:42.819 --> 00:13:45.470
would undermine with their pipeline

00:13:45.539 --> 00:13:49.828
is Russia's monopoly on the
Eastern European natural gas market.

00:13:49.899 --> 00:13:50.900
We both know that.

00:13:50.979 --> 00:13:54.586
If you block our proposal
and the pipeline is approved,

00:13:55.059 --> 00:13:57.744
oil falls below $79 a barrel

00:13:57.819 --> 00:13:59.503
and the Russian government
goes bankrupt.

00:13:59.579 --> 00:14:02.059
In our judgment,
your assessment is extreme.

00:14:02.139 --> 00:14:03.379
Thank you.

00:14:04.979 --> 00:14:08.461
Our request comes
from my country's highest level.

00:14:08.899 --> 00:14:11.903
And it is respectfully denied from mine.

00:14:12.899 --> 00:14:17.268
Then we will regard this as
an act of economic war.

00:14:17.339 --> 00:14:20.149
<i>While Wall Street talks up
the robust performance of the dollar,</i>

00:14:20.219 --> 00:14:21.983
<i>many commentators look to the U.N.</i>

00:14:22.059 --> 00:14:25.029
<i>and the bitter standoff
between the United States and Russia.</i>

00:14:25.099 --> 00:14:26.863
<i>The U.S. has the upper hand for now,</i>

00:14:26.939 --> 00:14:29.260
<i>but fears exist about exactly how
an angry Russia</i>

00:14:29.339 --> 00:14:32.786
<i>and Russian business
will react to the likely disastrous effects</i>

00:14:32.859 --> 00:14:35.863
<i>for the Russian economy
of America's U.N. veto.</i>

00:15:07.619 --> 00:15:10.270
Tell him he will need
somebody in Moscow.

00:15:10.379 --> 00:15:13.223
- He'll want you.
- No, I'm just an analyst.

00:15:13.499 --> 00:15:16.184
Our Russian partners
are hiding accounts from us.

00:15:16.379 --> 00:15:18.859
It's all in the data.

00:15:19.459 --> 00:15:21.461
Nobody else understands the data.

00:15:21.539 --> 00:15:24.622
Harper will want you.
Just get yourself to Moscow.

00:15:24.899 --> 00:15:26.947
Operator. Operator. Operator!

00:15:27.019 --> 00:15:28.259
Your call, please.

00:15:28.339 --> 00:15:30.945
Operator,
I've been ringing Murray Hill, 35097,

00:15:31.019 --> 00:15:32.942
for the last half hour
and the line is always busy.

00:15:33.019 --> 00:15:34.669
Will you ring it for me, please?

00:15:41.339 --> 00:15:42.625
Hello?

00:15:47.419 --> 00:15:48.659
Jack?

00:16:22.059 --> 00:16:23.390
You home yet?

00:16:57.699 --> 00:16:59.383
I bet you looked cute.

00:16:59.539 --> 00:17:01.189
<i>...overseas, where we see</i>

00:17:01.259 --> 00:17:03.580
<i>a surprisingly sturdy
performance by the dollar,</i>

00:17:03.659 --> 00:17:07.664
<i>holding its ground in spite of
the Turkish pipeline vote at the U.N.</i>

00:17:07.739 --> 00:17:09.389
<i>and the latest deficit news.
Anika, your reaction?</i>

00:17:09.459 --> 00:17:10.790
<i>Well, surprised,</i>

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:14.341
<i>pleased certainly, but this is extremely
unusual behavior by the market.</i>

00:17:14.419 --> 00:17:17.343
<i>Commodities should be moving in
the opposite direction of the dollar.</i>

00:17:17.419 --> 00:17:19.626
<i>You'd see a very
different direction by investors as well.</i>

00:17:19.699 --> 00:17:21.383
<i>They usually waver
from one day to the next...</i>

00:17:21.459 --> 00:17:22.790
Is work okay?

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:27.104
Yeah. Yeah, it was good.
Sorry about that. Yeah.

00:17:29.619 --> 00:17:32.623
So, you feel like a movie this weekend?

00:17:33.099 --> 00:17:34.146
Sure.

00:17:34.419 --> 00:17:37.707
There's a revival of Sony,
Wrong Number at the Film Forum.

00:17:37.779 --> 00:17:39.668
I was thinking that might be fun.

00:17:42.939 --> 00:17:43.986
Yeah.

00:17:46.419 --> 00:17:47.625
Have you ever seen it?

00:17:50.139 --> 00:17:52.460
You know what
I haven't seen is the waiter for, like,

00:17:52.779 --> 00:17:54.110
10 minutes. Have you seen him?

00:17:54.179 --> 00:17:55.339
- No.
- Where'd he run off to?

00:17:55.379 --> 00:17:58.064
Okay. So, should we go?

00:17:58.139 --> 00:17:59.982
- Sounds good.
- Good.

00:18:00.619 --> 00:18:01.745
Yeah. Let's do it.

00:18:02.059 --> 00:18:04.505
- For you, sir?
- Ah. Yeah, the lady will try it.

00:18:04.579 --> 00:18:07.025
Yes, I will try it. Thank you.

00:19:32.459 --> 00:19:34.939
Sorokin wants to meet you now.

00:19:50.939 --> 00:19:51.940
Ten minutes.

00:19:52.179 --> 00:19:53.180
Yes, Minister.

00:20:01.619 --> 00:20:05.226
I warned them of the outcome
at the U.N...

00:20:06.979 --> 00:20:09.027
...it was entirely predictable.

00:20:09.899 --> 00:20:13.460
It was a mistake for us to force a vote.

00:20:15.059 --> 00:20:22.784
You started moving assets when
the vote went against us, I hope?

00:20:23.459 --> 00:20:24.506
Yes, Minister.

00:20:26.419 --> 00:20:31.300
You understand the Kremlin
must remain entirely distanced.

00:20:32.619 --> 00:20:38.704
Anything you activate
must be self-contained.

00:20:44.499 --> 00:20:46.820
Is it the hour for 'Lamentations'?

00:20:48.659 --> 00:20:49.945
Lamentations?

00:20:50.259 --> 00:20:52.660
The Russian government is unaware...

00:20:53.339 --> 00:20:55.103
...of any such activity or operation.

00:20:55.859 --> 00:20:56.940
But of course.

00:21:10.099 --> 00:21:11.305
You want to go to Moscow?

00:21:11.499 --> 00:21:12.625
I think we have to.

00:21:12.819 --> 00:21:15.504
They're unnamed, uncategorized,
scattered all over the world.

00:21:15.579 --> 00:21:17.183
They're hidden accounts, Rob.

00:21:17.739 --> 00:21:19.662
These are just the ones
I managed to find.

00:21:19.739 --> 00:21:20.865
How did you find them?

00:21:21.779 --> 00:21:24.350
- You pay me to look.
- Not to look that hard.

00:21:26.339 --> 00:21:27.670
Joke.

00:21:28.499 --> 00:21:31.059
- You think they're ripping us off?
- I don't know what to think.

00:21:31.379 --> 00:21:33.700
Jesus H. Christ.

00:21:35.019 --> 00:21:39.661
You're the compliance officer.
It's your call, but can I ask one thing?

00:21:39.979 --> 00:21:42.869
Don't screw up the most
lucrative partnership this company has.

00:21:44.059 --> 00:21:46.221
Please? I'm not kidding.

00:21:46.419 --> 00:21:49.025
Viktor Cherevin is
completely unpredictable.

00:21:49.579 --> 00:21:51.502
And it's Russia.

00:21:51.579 --> 00:21:54.310
Insider trading is legal over there.
It's the Wild West.

00:21:54.379 --> 00:21:57.189
They're still ideologues,
but the new ideology is money.

00:21:57.619 --> 00:21:59.144
They're not a country,
they're a corporation.

00:21:59.219 --> 00:22:00.459
Which is why
we're there in the first place.

00:22:00.539 --> 00:22:02.621
- I know, don't rock the boat.
- It's not a boat.

00:22:02.699 --> 00:22:05.100
It's a goddamn luxury yacht
and we're all on it together.

00:22:05.179 --> 00:22:06.908
So, don't fucking sink us.

00:22:08.339 --> 00:22:09.340
Why don't you want me to come?

00:22:09.419 --> 00:22:11.148
Because I think you'd be bored
out of your mind.

00:22:11.219 --> 00:22:13.745
It's Moscow. How would I be bored?

00:22:13.819 --> 00:22:15.742
I'll be working the whole time.

00:22:16.019 --> 00:22:17.544
What about Paris?

00:22:18.139 --> 00:22:19.948
- What about Paris?
- Well, it isn't boring.

00:22:20.499 --> 00:22:21.910
And you won't be working.

00:22:22.219 --> 00:22:25.063
They owe me a long weekend.
You can meet me there when you're done.

00:22:28.419 --> 00:22:30.501
What do I have to do
to take a vacation with you?

00:22:31.019 --> 00:22:32.908
You can marry me
and call it a honeymoon.

00:22:33.899 --> 00:22:35.981
Why didn't you tell me
about the movie?

00:22:36.579 --> 00:22:37.580
What?

00:22:38.619 --> 00:22:40.348
Sony, Wrong Number.
You'd already seen it.

00:22:40.419 --> 00:22:41.864
There was a stub in your pocket.

00:22:42.179 --> 00:22:43.510
You went through my pockets.

00:22:44.859 --> 00:22:47.305
I folded your pants because
you throw them on the floor

00:22:47.379 --> 00:22:49.866
- and what I asked you...
- Why won't you just marry me, Cathy?

00:22:50.139 --> 00:22:51.823
Are you having an affair?

00:22:52.899 --> 00:22:54.867
Oh, God, no. No.

00:22:54.939 --> 00:22:56.589
Is that what this is?
Is that what you think?

00:22:56.659 --> 00:22:57.820
Who did you see the movie with?

00:22:57.899 --> 00:22:59.424
By myself.

00:22:59.499 --> 00:23:03.026
I'm a compliance officer.
I do everything by myself!

00:23:03.099 --> 00:23:04.180
It was a 1:45 show.

00:23:04.299 --> 00:23:05.983
I couldn't stare at
the goddamn computer screen anymore.

00:23:06.059 --> 00:23:09.586
You know what? If the job isn't right
for you, Jack, maybe it's time to move on!

00:23:24.059 --> 00:23:25.299
Paris.

00:23:26.619 --> 00:23:27.950
You and me.

00:23:29.299 --> 00:23:30.630
Okay?

00:23:53.939 --> 00:23:55.987
Dr. Ryan. Embee Deng.

00:23:56.099 --> 00:23:57.749
Private security for Cherevin Group.

00:23:58.299 --> 00:24:00.301
I'm your protective detail.

00:24:00.979 --> 00:24:02.026
I need a bodyguard?

00:24:02.179 --> 00:24:05.501
Think of me as your fancy driver.

00:24:10.739 --> 00:24:12.867
- Where are you from, Embee?
- Uganda.

00:24:12.939 --> 00:24:15.180
Cherevin only hires foreigners
for security.

00:24:15.259 --> 00:24:18.706
That way they know we're not FSB.

00:24:19.819 --> 00:24:22.220
Good afternoon, good afternoon.

00:24:29.379 --> 00:24:31.029
This way, Mr. Deng.

00:24:47.619 --> 00:24:50.543
Wow, St. Basil's Cathedral. Beautiful.

00:24:50.699 --> 00:24:53.748
It looks like ice cream.
Ice cream top.

00:24:59.459 --> 00:25:00.699
The Kremlin.

00:25:00.779 --> 00:25:02.144
Yes, yes.

00:25:03.099 --> 00:25:05.067
Ah, you speak some Russian.

00:25:08.779 --> 00:25:11.510
You go and register.
I'll help you upstairs with the bags.

00:25:11.579 --> 00:25:12.865
No. That's okay.
I can get it from here.

00:25:12.939 --> 00:25:14.589
I'm supposed to check the room.

00:25:14.659 --> 00:25:15.785
Okay.

00:25:17.219 --> 00:25:19.108
- Welcome, Mr. Ryan.
- Hi.

00:25:20.219 --> 00:25:22.825
- Just your signature, please.
- All right.

00:25:37.499 --> 00:25:40.981
Mr. Cherevin hopes
the room will be to your satisfaction.

00:25:46.179 --> 00:25:49.740
Ah, yes. And the view is second to none.

00:25:51.219 --> 00:25:52.709
Wow.

00:25:56.459 --> 00:25:57.540
It's magnificent!

00:29:11.059 --> 00:29:12.709
This is Cornerback. I have a situation.

00:29:12.779 --> 00:29:14.019
You have 85 seconds.

00:29:14.339 --> 00:29:15.829
- I need help.
- Category?

00:29:15.979 --> 00:29:17.424
Somebody tried to kill me.
There's a body.

00:29:17.499 --> 00:29:18.580
Are you intact?

00:29:18.819 --> 00:29:20.059
Close enough.

00:29:20.299 --> 00:29:22.461
Location?

00:29:22.539 --> 00:29:23.825
Cornerback?

00:29:23.899 --> 00:29:26.789
The Grushnitsky Hotel, Moscow.

00:29:28.939 --> 00:29:30.100
Oh, no.

00:29:30.499 --> 00:29:32.103
15 to 20 minutes.

00:29:32.299 --> 00:29:35.348
Maintain the room.
Wait for two rings, then exit.

00:29:35.819 --> 00:29:39.187
Go quiet until 21:30 local
and surface at location Gamma.

00:29:39.259 --> 00:29:40.499
I...

00:29:40.579 --> 00:29:42.581
Contact bench at the base of the stairs.

00:29:42.659 --> 00:29:45.981
I don't remember where that is.

00:29:47.099 --> 00:29:48.100
Confirm.

00:29:48.179 --> 00:29:51.388
I heard you, I just don't remember
the address, okay?

00:29:51.579 --> 00:29:54.150
I'm just an analyst.
I only did three weeks at the Farm.

00:29:54.219 --> 00:29:56.221
You are breaking protocol, Cornerback.

00:29:56.299 --> 00:29:58.586
I'm out of my goddamn element
is what I am.

00:29:58.659 --> 00:30:00.184
I just need the address.

00:30:00.339 --> 00:30:03.104
Go back to your room and stay there
until the phone rings twice.

00:30:03.179 --> 00:30:04.988
Then leave quickly and quietly.

00:30:05.059 --> 00:30:07.266
Keep out of sight until 9:30 local time.

00:30:07.339 --> 00:30:09.467
- Then, go to Staraya Square, the steps.
- Okay.

00:30:09.539 --> 00:30:11.906
Your contact will be on the bench.

00:30:11.979 --> 00:30:13.310
Cornerback?

00:30:13.379 --> 00:30:14.540
Yeah.

00:30:15.059 --> 00:30:16.185
You're a Marine.

00:30:16.259 --> 00:30:18.785
It's the reason
you're still alive right now.

00:30:18.939 --> 00:30:21.829
Remember your tradecraft
and you'll be fine.

00:30:23.539 --> 00:30:24.904
Thank you.

00:30:24.979 --> 00:30:26.105
Time's up.

00:32:07.499 --> 00:32:09.069
Hey, I was just about to call you.

00:32:09.139 --> 00:32:10.220
Hey.

00:32:10.299 --> 00:32:12.427
Yeah, I only landed
a couple hours ago, so...

00:32:12.499 --> 00:32:15.264
Oh, good.
I'm not trying to hassle you, I just...

00:32:15.619 --> 00:32:18.020
I just wanted to make sure
the trip was okay.

00:32:18.099 --> 00:32:20.420
Yeah. Yeah, it was,
you know, uneventful.

00:32:20.699 --> 00:32:23.464
Well, that's the best kind.

00:32:23.659 --> 00:32:24.865
So, what are you doing now?

00:32:24.979 --> 00:32:27.550
I just left the hotel. Gonna...

00:32:28.099 --> 00:32:29.988
Got to go meet a colleague.

00:32:30.379 --> 00:32:31.505
Anybody interesting?

00:32:32.019 --> 00:32:35.546
I don't think you know him.
What are you up to?

00:32:36.019 --> 00:32:38.420
Well, I was just on call for a 48,

00:32:38.539 --> 00:32:42.339
but Saidelman says
that he can cover me for the weekend.

00:32:43.539 --> 00:32:45.223
So I thought,

00:32:45.299 --> 00:32:48.701
if I got on a plane tonight,
I could be in Paris in the morning.

00:32:49.019 --> 00:32:50.450
You think you could get away early?

00:32:56.219 --> 00:32:57.266
Hello?

00:32:58.059 --> 00:33:00.346
Yeah, you know, I...

00:33:02.779 --> 00:33:04.463
I don't think so, Cath.

00:33:04.539 --> 00:33:06.780
I think I'm gonna be tied up
longer than I thought.

00:33:06.899 --> 00:33:08.060
I'm not...

00:33:09.579 --> 00:33:12.742
I'm not sure
I'm gonna be able to make it there at all.

00:33:13.939 --> 00:33:16.385
Well, it sounds like you're having fun.

00:33:16.739 --> 00:33:18.628
Look, sweetheart, I'm...

00:33:19.219 --> 00:33:21.825
I'm late and I'm tired.
I'm pretty jetlagged.

00:33:21.939 --> 00:33:23.803
Can I give you a call
in the morning, my time?

00:33:24.619 --> 00:33:25.825
Okay.

00:33:29.779 --> 00:33:32.544
I love you desperately.
You know that, don't you?

00:33:33.379 --> 00:33:34.505
Yep.

00:33:35.939 --> 00:33:37.509
Don't lose faith in me.

00:33:41.259 --> 00:33:42.385
Okay.

00:34:11.619 --> 00:34:12.905
You Okay?

00:34:15.259 --> 00:34:16.465
Sit down.

00:34:20.539 --> 00:34:23.622
You got to pick somebody to trust, Jack.
Now, sit down.

00:34:34.979 --> 00:34:36.026
You brought your dog?

00:34:38.859 --> 00:34:40.668
Q.P. dog.

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:43.902
Quasi-Personal.
Why else am I out for a walk?

00:34:44.819 --> 00:34:45.980
Grabbed it out of somebody's yard.

00:34:46.059 --> 00:34:48.869
They'll be thrilled when
he turns up in the morning.

00:34:52.499 --> 00:34:55.184
It's better they're shaking
afterwards than during.

00:35:02.339 --> 00:35:05.070
First person I ever killed,
Jack, was innocent.

00:35:06.819 --> 00:35:09.299
- What did he do?
- She.

00:35:11.459 --> 00:35:14.190
She didn't do anything.
She was a bystander.

00:35:15.379 --> 00:35:17.029
Somebody who just...

00:35:18.339 --> 00:35:20.865
Just came up behind me too quick.

00:35:21.699 --> 00:35:22.860
Jesus.

00:35:23.339 --> 00:35:25.421
How do you get over
something like that?

00:35:26.139 --> 00:35:28.141
If you're lucky, you get past it.

00:35:30.179 --> 00:35:32.580
- That's not the same thing.
- No, it isn't.

00:35:32.659 --> 00:35:35.390
Now talk me through
your very scary memo,

00:35:36.539 --> 00:35:40.260
but keep in mind
I don't have your Ph.D.

00:35:42.339 --> 00:35:44.467
Two weeks ago, I noticed
a series of accounts

00:35:44.539 --> 00:35:46.064
in our Russian partner's records

00:35:46.139 --> 00:35:49.222
to which our company's
computers are denied access.

00:35:49.659 --> 00:35:51.707
Massive currency accounts,

00:35:52.219 --> 00:35:54.142
all in U.S. Treasuries.

00:35:55.339 --> 00:35:57.819
Cherevin's made a total
commitment to U.S. dollars

00:35:57.899 --> 00:36:00.027
when there's been
a hurricane in the Gulf

00:36:00.099 --> 00:36:02.545
and a string of negative
economic reports.

00:36:03.899 --> 00:36:04.900
What does it mean?

00:36:05.019 --> 00:36:06.748
It's external sterilized intervention.

00:36:06.899 --> 00:36:08.389
Like I'm an idiot, please?

00:36:08.499 --> 00:36:11.821
The dollar should be
going down, but it's up.

00:36:12.219 --> 00:36:14.506
A few cents every day, the past week.

00:36:15.819 --> 00:36:17.230
I think they're propping us up.

00:36:17.939 --> 00:36:19.020
Why?

00:36:21.379 --> 00:36:24.508
I think there's a coordinated plot
within Russia

00:36:25.379 --> 00:36:27.746
to collapse the dollar
and crash the U.S. economy.

00:36:27.819 --> 00:36:30.106
And it's going to happen soon.

00:36:30.899 --> 00:36:34.108
It'll be timed to follow a
terrorist attack on U.S. soil.

00:36:34.179 --> 00:36:35.943
No, that'd be crazy.
The Russians would lose

00:36:36.019 --> 00:36:37.908
- as much as anybody in a collapse.
- No. No, no, no,

00:36:37.979 --> 00:36:40.141
the Chinese will lose more.

00:36:40.499 --> 00:36:41.989
And once the Russians start to sell,

00:36:42.059 --> 00:36:45.506
the rest of the world
is gonna dump every dollar they have.

00:36:47.979 --> 00:36:50.550
All right, let's say it's happened.
Let's say you're right.

00:36:50.619 --> 00:36:52.348
What's the aftermath?

00:36:52.619 --> 00:36:53.700
They'll recover.

00:36:54.419 --> 00:36:57.502
We won't.
We don't have their oil reserves.

00:36:58.299 --> 00:37:00.108
We're looking at the Panic of 1837,

00:37:00.179 --> 00:37:03.422
the Panic of 1893,
the Soviet Famine of 1932.

00:37:03.499 --> 00:37:04.580
Hyperinflation.

00:37:04.659 --> 00:37:06.980
Bread lines. Rioting.

00:37:07.099 --> 00:37:08.430
I know, I get it.

00:37:09.339 --> 00:37:11.387
And at first, though,
they'll call it the American crisis,

00:37:11.459 --> 00:37:14.285
but within about six weeks,
they're gonna start calling it what it is.

00:37:17.779 --> 00:37:19.349
The Second Great Depression.

00:37:21.939 --> 00:37:24.419
The attack and the sell-off have to be
timed to each other.

00:37:25.219 --> 00:37:27.028
A massive series
of transactions like that

00:37:27.099 --> 00:37:28.510
have to be programmed in advance

00:37:28.619 --> 00:37:30.348
and stored in Cherevin's system.

00:37:30.979 --> 00:37:32.663
Once I start the audit, I can get the date

00:37:32.739 --> 00:37:34.707
and time of the attack
down to the minute.

00:37:41.579 --> 00:37:43.627
You stick to
the scheduled audit tomorrow.

00:37:44.219 --> 00:37:46.221
Everything official, everything in public.

00:37:46.699 --> 00:37:47.825
You'll be fine.

00:37:49.339 --> 00:37:51.103
I need for you to be fine.

00:37:53.179 --> 00:37:56.900
Your room should be clean by now.
We'll put a watch on it.

00:37:58.459 --> 00:37:59.870
I drowned him.

00:38:02.539 --> 00:38:04.303
In about that much water.

00:38:08.539 --> 00:38:11.145
You know, you sold this
as an office job.

00:38:20.739 --> 00:38:22.867
You're not just an analyst anymore.

00:38:24.059 --> 00:38:25.584
You're operational now.

00:40:47.659 --> 00:40:49.707
We will avenge our mother Russia.

00:40:50.179 --> 00:40:52.341
You will avenge our family.

00:40:52.739 --> 00:40:54.867
America will bleed.

00:40:55.339 --> 00:40:57.023
Good luck, Aleksandr.

00:41:21.539 --> 00:41:24.019
Everyone is in place, sir,
in America and in Moscow.

00:41:24.219 --> 00:41:25.709
Let it begin.

00:42:05.419 --> 00:42:08.025
Hi. Jack Ryan to see Mr. Cherevin.

00:42:08.099 --> 00:42:11.023
- One moment, please.
- Dr. Ryan? I'm Katya,

00:42:11.139 --> 00:42:13.870
Mr. Cherevin's assistant.
He's expecting you.

00:42:47.579 --> 00:42:49.741
I may be here a few days.
Will I get my own card?

00:42:49.939 --> 00:42:53.466
As a foreign guest,
you'll need to be accompanied.

00:42:54.379 --> 00:42:55.790
You understand?

00:42:56.779 --> 00:42:57.826
Of course.

00:43:27.499 --> 00:43:28.830
Viktor Cherevin.

00:43:29.019 --> 00:43:30.066
Jack Ryan.

00:43:30.979 --> 00:43:33.744
- How was your flight?
- Fine, thank you.

00:43:34.139 --> 00:43:35.709
And the jet lag?

00:43:38.779 --> 00:43:40.747
That first night can be brutal.

00:43:42.259 --> 00:43:43.499
I survived.

00:43:44.979 --> 00:43:47.903
That's a nice painting.
Napoleon at war.

00:43:48.419 --> 00:43:50.103
So, you know your history.

00:43:50.699 --> 00:43:52.030
What can I do for you?

00:43:52.859 --> 00:43:54.099
Routine audit.

00:43:54.539 --> 00:43:56.826
So routine it couldn't be done
from New York?

00:43:57.419 --> 00:43:59.899
Not when you're
concealing accounts from us.

00:44:02.539 --> 00:44:05.588
You Americans like to think
of yourselves as direct.

00:44:05.859 --> 00:44:08.226
But I wonder if perhaps
you are just rude.

00:44:10.539 --> 00:44:12.348
You Russians think
of yourselves as poets,

00:44:12.419 --> 00:44:14.706
but perhaps you're just touchy.

00:44:19.259 --> 00:44:22.069
Nothing here is concealed.
Only secured.

00:44:24.539 --> 00:44:25.870
Excuse me.

00:44:29.579 --> 00:44:32.469
I hope I can count on full access
to your account files?

00:44:33.099 --> 00:44:34.430
You won't need it.

00:44:35.019 --> 00:44:37.021
I ordered the companies
which concerned you,

00:44:37.099 --> 00:44:38.669
quite unnecessarily, I might add,

00:44:38.739 --> 00:44:40.628
to be sold, at a profit.

00:44:40.699 --> 00:44:42.861
Your firm's percentages
are detailed in this report.

00:44:42.939 --> 00:44:44.350
The funds were transferred
this morning,

00:44:44.419 --> 00:44:46.626
too late, alas,
to stop you from getting on your flight.

00:44:46.699 --> 00:44:48.428
So, you see, an audit would be

00:44:48.499 --> 00:44:50.900
quite without purpose
at this point, Mr. Ryan.

00:44:52.619 --> 00:44:53.825
I see.

00:44:55.019 --> 00:44:57.260
Partnerships are delicate, Mr. Ryan.

00:44:58.539 --> 00:45:00.462
Sometimes, they end violently.

00:45:01.579 --> 00:45:03.866
Dimitri Lemkov,
our head of security.

00:45:04.539 --> 00:45:05.700
Jack Ryan.

00:45:08.299 --> 00:45:11.223
I'm sorry you had to come
all this way for nothing, Mr. Ryan.

00:45:16.779 --> 00:45:18.986
I hear the finest restaurant

00:45:19.059 --> 00:45:22.029
in Moscow is across the street.

00:45:24.019 --> 00:45:26.829
In honor of our partnership
and to, quite frankly,

00:45:26.899 --> 00:45:29.903
apologize for my mistake,

00:45:30.659 --> 00:45:32.309
perhaps I could take you to dinner.

00:45:33.699 --> 00:45:34.746
No.

00:45:35.979 --> 00:45:37.140
But I'll take you.

00:45:38.019 --> 00:45:40.784
And I insist my driver
pick you up from your hotel.

00:45:41.099 --> 00:45:43.022
Moscow can be very dangerous.

00:45:43.379 --> 00:45:45.029
Our own man, for example,

00:45:45.099 --> 00:45:47.750
who collected you from the airport.
Embee.

00:45:47.979 --> 00:45:51.745
We are very concerned.
He has simply disappeared.

00:45:51.939 --> 00:45:53.065
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:45:53.139 --> 00:45:55.745
No doubt he will turn up
in a day or two,

00:45:55.859 --> 00:45:57.827
hung-over and remorseful.

00:45:58.059 --> 00:46:00.346
Will your wife be joining us tonight?

00:46:03.979 --> 00:46:05.504
I'm not married.

00:46:05.899 --> 00:46:09.346
I was just told that
she had arrived at your hotel.

00:46:10.539 --> 00:46:11.950
My girlfriend.

00:46:12.059 --> 00:46:13.982
Even better, and our little secret.

00:46:15.459 --> 00:46:16.699
You're having fun with me.

00:46:16.859 --> 00:46:19.624
Not nearly enough. Bring her along
tonight. We won't go otherwise.

00:46:20.179 --> 00:46:21.624
I'll be sure to ask.

00:46:22.939 --> 00:46:24.509
A pleasure to have met you both.

00:46:31.499 --> 00:46:32.785
He's dangerous.

00:46:55.219 --> 00:46:56.220
I lost him.

00:47:06.219 --> 00:47:07.630
You're done already?

00:47:07.739 --> 00:47:08.740
He's outplayed us.

00:47:08.819 --> 00:47:10.264
You didn't get anything?

00:47:11.059 --> 00:47:13.505
Nothing. Not one thing.

00:47:14.219 --> 00:47:16.586
He sold all the assets.

00:47:17.059 --> 00:47:19.187
He probably moved them
to other shell companies.

00:47:19.259 --> 00:47:21.500
But I can't audit
what they technically don't own.

00:47:22.499 --> 00:47:24.786
- All right. We still need the algorithm.
- Yeah.

00:47:26.659 --> 00:47:28.548
Yeah. I invited him to dinner.

00:47:29.419 --> 00:47:32.070
The restaurant is across the street
from his building.

00:47:33.539 --> 00:47:35.223
What if we...

00:47:36.459 --> 00:47:37.699
What if what?

00:47:37.779 --> 00:47:38.926
- I don't know.
- What, Jack?

00:47:38.939 --> 00:47:40.179
Well, what if we...

00:47:40.259 --> 00:47:41.499
You wanna break into their system?

00:47:41.579 --> 00:47:43.149
- Yeah, I think someone should.
- You think we can?

00:47:43.219 --> 00:47:44.550
Yeah... I don't know.

00:47:44.619 --> 00:47:46.144
Put it up, the restaurant.

00:47:46.219 --> 00:47:48.108
The orders to sell the dollar would be

00:47:48.179 --> 00:47:50.546
encrypted on the computer
of the security director.

00:47:50.939 --> 00:47:52.270
Dimitri Lemkov?

00:47:52.779 --> 00:47:54.349
Former FSB.

00:47:54.419 --> 00:47:55.864
We can't break into his office.

00:47:55.939 --> 00:47:57.304
It's secured six different ways.

00:47:57.379 --> 00:47:59.108
So, what about the office next to his?

00:47:59.619 --> 00:48:00.825
Well, that's Cherevin's.

00:48:00.899 --> 00:48:02.025
Can we get into that?

00:48:02.099 --> 00:48:05.990
Maybe someone could
if they had his access card.

00:48:06.099 --> 00:48:09.103
We're developing a security guard,
but we don't have him yet.

00:48:09.219 --> 00:48:10.550
Well, develop harder.

00:48:12.939 --> 00:48:14.225
He drinks, right?

00:48:14.299 --> 00:48:15.585
Like a Russian.

00:48:16.219 --> 00:48:19.462
Also chases women.
The more married, the better.

00:48:22.339 --> 00:48:24.785
Okay, tell your guy once he's in there,

00:48:24.979 --> 00:48:28.984
he needs to enable all encrypted
financial sell order packages.

00:48:29.139 --> 00:48:31.380
Tell him to look
for dark pool algorithms.

00:48:31.979 --> 00:48:34.266
And if your guy, if the guy...

00:48:38.819 --> 00:48:40.423
I'm the guy, aren't I?

00:48:40.979 --> 00:48:43.823
Yeah. You're going to be great.

00:48:44.819 --> 00:48:46.742
But you've got another problem, Jack.

00:48:57.819 --> 00:48:59.264
So I dropped everything,

00:48:59.499 --> 00:49:01.979
and I called in every favor that I knew

00:49:02.059 --> 00:49:05.506
and I spent four hours
at the consulate begging for a visa.

00:49:05.779 --> 00:49:08.749
You know,
I wanted to make this grand gesture.

00:49:08.859 --> 00:49:11.066
I wanted you to see
what you meant to me.

00:49:11.179 --> 00:49:13.466
So, I'm here.

00:49:14.139 --> 00:49:16.460
And you have to say something.

00:49:17.379 --> 00:49:22.180
Well, maybe it's...
Maybe it's awful or hurtful or shameful.

00:49:22.539 --> 00:49:26.146
I don't know. But you have to talk to me.

00:49:27.539 --> 00:49:29.701
You can't let me think
that I'm crazy anymore.

00:49:31.339 --> 00:49:33.421
Because now I know that I'm not.

00:49:35.899 --> 00:49:37.469
Just talk to me.

00:49:39.419 --> 00:49:41.023
Will you meet me halfway?

00:49:53.179 --> 00:49:54.749
I'm in the CIA.

00:49:58.699 --> 00:50:00.064
Thank God.

00:50:03.899 --> 00:50:06.061
I thought you were having an affair.

00:50:13.019 --> 00:50:13.986
Is everything in place?

00:50:14.059 --> 00:50:16.869
Yes, Mr. Cherevin, our asset
in the U.S. has been contacted.

00:50:17.019 --> 00:50:18.066
He's prepared?

00:50:18.419 --> 00:50:20.899
Yes, sir. Merely awaiting your order.

00:50:21.059 --> 00:50:23.903
We will strike... tomorrow.

00:50:24.179 --> 00:50:27.945
Very well, sir.
Sell orders have all been entered.

00:50:29.539 --> 00:50:30.586
It's time.

00:50:31.259 --> 00:50:32.829
We will activate our asset immediately.

00:50:43.779 --> 00:50:45.907
And this must be Aleksandr.

00:50:45.979 --> 00:50:47.629
The prodigal returns.

00:50:47.979 --> 00:50:51.745
He may not be a regular churchgoer,
but he's a good man, my son.

00:50:51.819 --> 00:50:53.628
He just turned 21.

00:50:53.699 --> 00:50:56.464
And he already
has a job at the auto plant.

00:51:07.259 --> 00:51:09.148
It was stupid to mention the job.

00:51:10.299 --> 00:51:11.983
A real mother would.

00:51:12.059 --> 00:51:14.061
It wasn't necessary.

00:51:15.739 --> 00:51:18.219
Today's reading
is from the Book Of Lamentations...

00:51:18.379 --> 00:51:20.222
...chapter 2, verse 2...

00:51:20.299 --> 00:51:21.983
Lamentations.

00:51:26.499 --> 00:51:28.183
We've been activated.

00:51:29.059 --> 00:51:30.902
Thank God.

00:51:31.659 --> 00:51:34.310
He has torn down the strongholds

00:51:34.659 --> 00:51:36.343
...of the daughter of Judah.

00:51:36.419 --> 00:51:37.909
He has brought her kingdom...

00:51:37.979 --> 00:51:40.983
...and its princes
down to the ground in dishonor.

00:51:51.019 --> 00:51:53.067
The timing of the attack
has been brought forward.

00:51:53.459 --> 00:51:54.460
We leave tonight.

00:51:56.179 --> 00:51:57.180
Take nothing with you.

00:52:05.859 --> 00:52:07.702
There is one loose end to tie up first.

00:52:18.459 --> 00:52:20.985
<i>Playing the hottest music in Detroit.</i>

00:52:21.059 --> 00:52:23.027
<i>Feel the heat now.</i>

00:52:45.619 --> 00:52:46.780
Hey.

00:52:47.379 --> 00:52:48.346
Hey.

00:52:48.419 --> 00:52:49.420
Excuse me.

00:52:50.619 --> 00:52:51.905
You look kind of lost.

00:53:19.459 --> 00:53:23.225
So, I'll have to keep him busy
at the table for what?

00:53:23.299 --> 00:53:24.869
Ten minutes?
To be on the safe side?

00:53:24.939 --> 00:53:26.145
What are you talking about?
You're not going.

00:53:26.219 --> 00:53:27.789
You said he insisted I come to dinner.

00:53:27.859 --> 00:53:30.100
- It'll look suspicious if I don't show up.
- No, no, it won't.

00:53:30.179 --> 00:53:31.180
She's right, Jack.

00:53:31.259 --> 00:53:32.545
To him, something will be off.

00:53:32.619 --> 00:53:33.700
You're not involving her in this.

00:53:33.779 --> 00:53:35.986
You involved me in this
by not telling me.

00:53:36.099 --> 00:53:37.180
You got to get her out of here.
Send her home.

00:53:37.259 --> 00:53:38.943
Well, what are you gonna tell Cherevin?
That I'm homesick?

00:53:39.019 --> 00:53:41.386
These are dangerous people, Cathy.
You cannot be here.

00:53:41.459 --> 00:53:43.499
If you'd told me who you really were,
I wouldn't be.

00:53:43.539 --> 00:53:44.700
I took an oath!

00:53:45.099 --> 00:53:46.430
I took an oath.

00:53:46.499 --> 00:53:48.228
I couldn't tell you
unless we were married.

00:53:48.299 --> 00:53:50.222
- And you wouldn't marry me!
- That's why you wanted to marry me,

00:53:50.299 --> 00:53:51.380
so that you could tell somebody

00:53:51.459 --> 00:53:52.506
- that you were in the CIA?
- No, of course not.

00:53:52.579 --> 00:53:54.741
You lied to me for three years
and you were good at it.

00:53:54.819 --> 00:53:56.309
I think you actually enjoyed it.

00:53:56.379 --> 00:53:58.381
Can we have a minute, please?

00:53:58.459 --> 00:53:59.620
No, you can't.

00:53:59.699 --> 00:54:01.224
I would like to talk to Jack alone.

00:54:01.299 --> 00:54:03.825
This is geopolitics,
it's not couples therapy.

00:54:06.939 --> 00:54:09.749
Do I really have to remind you
what's at stake here, Jack?

00:54:10.259 --> 00:54:13.627
There's a very real scenario here
where we don't get out of this alive.

00:54:16.139 --> 00:54:17.504
Any of us.

00:54:18.059 --> 00:54:20.061
And neither do a lot
of innocent people back home.

00:54:20.139 --> 00:54:23.063
Now, we had about eight minutes
to discuss this little...

00:54:23.819 --> 00:54:26.026
This little development.
We just used four of them.

00:54:26.419 --> 00:54:28.945
We don't need you to break
into Lemkov's computer,

00:54:29.019 --> 00:54:30.509
just into the office next to his.

00:54:30.579 --> 00:54:32.468
You plug this into any 220 outlet

00:54:32.539 --> 00:54:34.189
that shares the same wall with him.

00:54:34.259 --> 00:54:37.945
We use the building's own electrical
wiring to access Lemkov's hard drive.

00:54:38.059 --> 00:54:40.790
How much time will he need
to run the program?

00:54:40.899 --> 00:54:43.106
Five, six minutes, including movement.

00:54:43.179 --> 00:54:45.386
So the answer to your question, yes.

00:54:45.499 --> 00:54:47.661
10 minutes at the table ought to do it.

00:54:49.259 --> 00:54:50.624
All right.

00:54:50.699 --> 00:54:52.986
You know, we catch a few breaks,
we can all be

00:54:53.059 --> 00:54:55.221
headed home on a plane
by midnight.

00:54:55.299 --> 00:54:57.586
Cherevin will be at dinner in...

00:54:57.659 --> 00:54:59.821
- Cathy.
- 55 minutes.

00:55:00.219 --> 00:55:02.028
- Then I should get dressed.
- Cathy.

00:55:08.379 --> 00:55:09.540
I like her.

00:55:10.219 --> 00:55:12.347
If Cherevin touches her, I'll kill him.

00:55:12.939 --> 00:55:14.703
It's just dinner, Jack.

00:55:15.499 --> 00:55:17.342
The most he can do is look.

00:55:18.059 --> 00:55:19.948
And to be honest, we need him to.

00:55:47.299 --> 00:55:49.825
- Good morning.
- Morning.

00:55:53.499 --> 00:55:55.501
Do you know what happened
three years ago today?

00:55:56.579 --> 00:55:58.547
You agreed to stop
wearing cargo shorts?

00:55:58.739 --> 00:56:01.948
I did. I did, it broke my heart.

00:56:02.419 --> 00:56:05.343
All that storage capacity.
Incredible. Incredible shorts.

00:56:05.619 --> 00:56:07.826
No, but once I did

00:56:07.899 --> 00:56:09.867
agree to make pants
a part of the new me,

00:56:09.939 --> 00:56:12.670
you finally agreed to go out with me.

00:56:12.899 --> 00:56:15.300
Well, I couldn't very well
date a patient, could I?

00:56:17.019 --> 00:56:18.544
Could you marry one?

00:56:22.459 --> 00:56:24.188
'Cause I'm in love with you, Doctor.

00:56:32.939 --> 00:56:34.464
Oh, my God.

00:56:46.459 --> 00:56:49.303
I'd appreciate it if you would wear
the ring in public.

00:56:53.419 --> 00:56:55.990
I left it in the hotel room.

00:56:57.339 --> 00:56:58.579
I know.

00:56:59.539 --> 00:57:00.825
I found it.

00:57:04.659 --> 00:57:07.822
He's expecting to meet my fiancee.
And this is

00:57:09.459 --> 00:57:11.939
his driver.
So please don't embarrass me.

00:57:44.099 --> 00:57:46.261
Ah, the Ryans.

00:57:46.379 --> 00:57:49.064
Perfect American couple. Welcome.

00:57:49.539 --> 00:57:52.543
Viktor Cherevin, my fiancée, Dr. Muller.

00:57:52.739 --> 00:57:55.709
Dr. Muller, you are so beautiful.

00:58:09.539 --> 00:58:10.950
Lemkov's headed out.

00:58:17.219 --> 00:58:19.221
Jack, it's show time.

00:58:21.859 --> 00:58:25.102
I hope you will enjoy the Haut-Brion.
It's a very special wine.

00:58:28.259 --> 00:58:30.580
You find it amusing.

00:58:32.619 --> 00:58:33.859
Jack had an early start.

00:58:33.939 --> 00:58:35.065
So it seems.

00:58:38.379 --> 00:58:40.620
Hey. Can I get
another one of these?

00:58:40.739 --> 00:58:43.390
This is good, Viktor.

00:58:46.739 --> 00:58:48.662
Jack has a back injury.

00:58:50.139 --> 00:58:51.425
From Afghanistan.

00:58:51.899 --> 00:58:53.139
Me, too.

00:58:53.539 --> 00:58:56.065
Different time, different empire,
same graveyard.

00:58:56.859 --> 00:58:59.066
- My son's, also.
- Sorry to hear that.

00:58:59.779 --> 00:59:03.101
Mujahideen grenade fragment
is lodged in my hip to this day.

00:59:03.259 --> 00:59:05.421
I wouldn't think a hand grenade

00:59:05.539 --> 00:59:07.701
would be the first thing
you'd wanna keep on your desk.

00:59:07.779 --> 00:59:09.269
A reminder of a vanquished rival.

00:59:09.579 --> 00:59:11.627
- You lost the war.
- But I beat your grenade.

00:59:11.779 --> 00:59:12.826
My grenade?

00:59:12.939 --> 00:59:14.907
One supplied by your CIA.

00:59:19.059 --> 00:59:20.220
Perhaps.

00:59:20.739 --> 00:59:21.900
Perhaps.

00:59:24.579 --> 00:59:28.300
Well, I'm no medical doctor
like my illustrious fiancee here,

00:59:28.379 --> 00:59:30.950
but I would recommend
a Percocet or three for that hip.

00:59:31.019 --> 00:59:33.260
With a nice, hearty red like this,

00:59:33.339 --> 00:59:35.626
you won't know
your own name in an hour.

00:59:36.299 --> 00:59:38.301
What? Come on,
don't give me that look, Cathy.

00:59:38.379 --> 00:59:40.905
I'm not gonna be policed
at the dinner table.

00:59:42.139 --> 00:59:43.504
Do you want one?

00:59:43.819 --> 00:59:45.787
- I think not.
- Are you sure?

00:59:46.299 --> 00:59:47.710
Oh, I'm sure.

00:59:50.579 --> 00:59:52.581
You are so attractive like this.

00:59:52.699 --> 00:59:53.860
Chin-chin.

00:59:53.939 --> 00:59:55.350
Will you excuse me, please?

00:59:58.939 --> 01:00:00.828
Jack, I speak no Russian.

01:00:00.899 --> 01:00:02.663
Is it too much to ask to be escorted?

01:00:02.739 --> 01:00:05.185
Oh, it's just the bathroom, Cathy.
It's just the bathroom.

01:00:05.259 --> 01:00:07.182
- Please. Allow me.
- Thank you.

01:00:07.819 --> 01:00:09.230
Nice work, Jack.

01:00:11.979 --> 01:00:13.105
I'm sorry.

01:00:29.499 --> 01:00:30.705
I got it.

01:00:31.059 --> 01:00:32.299
Okay.

01:00:35.859 --> 01:00:36.860
Exit.

01:00:37.219 --> 01:00:38.550
Snowball is rolling.

01:00:40.699 --> 01:00:41.939
Okay to go.

01:00:42.019 --> 01:00:43.225
Step it up.

01:00:45.459 --> 01:00:46.699
Viktor!

01:00:47.859 --> 01:00:49.543
Viktor, Viktor, Viktor. Tell me.

01:00:49.619 --> 01:00:51.701
Which would you rather?
Pick one.

01:00:52.339 --> 01:00:55.741
Either you live in some
miserable shithole, you have no money,

01:00:56.379 --> 01:00:57.585
but you're single.

01:00:58.579 --> 01:01:02.379
Or you're rich,
you live in some fantastic apartment,

01:01:02.459 --> 01:01:04.507
but you have to be, good God,

01:01:04.579 --> 01:01:07.742
you have to be in a relationship.

01:01:10.579 --> 01:01:12.229
What do you think?

01:01:13.579 --> 01:01:16.150
- I'll leave the night to the two of you.
- I won't allow it.

01:01:16.699 --> 01:01:18.906
I think one of us needs to take a walk.

01:01:20.179 --> 01:01:22.546
I think you should
consider her suggestion.

01:01:39.219 --> 01:01:41.108
Please, sit down.

01:02:39.499 --> 01:02:40.580
He's in.

01:02:56.819 --> 01:02:59.106
You flew all the way to Moscow
to surprise him

01:02:59.179 --> 01:03:01.307
or to catch him, which was it?

01:03:01.859 --> 01:03:03.270
That's a rather personal question.

01:03:03.819 --> 01:03:05.583
Would you prefer impersonal?

01:03:05.659 --> 01:03:08.185
I'd rather talk than make
chit-chat, wouldn't you?

01:03:10.339 --> 01:03:13.024
If we're going to be married,
I'd like to know that I can trust him.

01:03:13.139 --> 01:03:14.186
Trust.

01:03:14.979 --> 01:03:16.026
Truth.

01:03:16.219 --> 01:03:19.109
I think it's like most opinions,
best unexpressed.

01:03:21.539 --> 01:03:23.223
You talk like Pechorin.

01:03:24.419 --> 01:03:26.183
You've read <i>A Hero Of Our Time?</i>

01:03:26.459 --> 01:03:28.268
I had a misspent sophomore year.

01:03:28.339 --> 01:03:29.545
Really?

01:03:29.779 --> 01:03:32.703
I love Lermontov.
That Russian romanticism is so

01:03:34.219 --> 01:03:35.550
achingly desperate.

01:03:35.859 --> 01:03:39.068
Desperate, yes. And insatiable.

01:04:27.939 --> 01:04:31.421
It's about not aging
before your time.

01:04:31.499 --> 01:04:34.070
You don't understand.
Aging isn't the problem.

01:04:34.139 --> 01:04:36.460
Dying the proper way,
that is the problem.

01:04:36.579 --> 01:04:38.219
Not if you've lived a life
without regret.

01:04:38.259 --> 01:04:40.307
How on earth does one do that?

01:04:40.459 --> 01:04:43.781
Regret. It piles up around us
like books we never read.

01:04:44.619 --> 01:04:46.064
Well, that's the past.

01:04:47.419 --> 01:04:49.069
Can you live the rest
of your life without regret?

01:04:49.139 --> 01:04:52.222
Yes, perhaps.
If I feel I have done something

01:04:52.299 --> 01:04:54.870
truly great for my country.

01:04:56.739 --> 01:04:59.185
Something my children
would have found important.

01:05:02.139 --> 01:05:03.425
Would have?

01:05:05.979 --> 01:05:07.504
You're incredibly beautiful.

01:05:09.579 --> 01:05:12.742
I hope Jack Ryan realizes
how fortunate he is.

01:05:14.539 --> 01:05:15.620
- Ready.
- Okay.

01:05:16.339 --> 01:05:17.340
Go.

01:05:34.219 --> 01:05:35.220
Okay.

01:05:56.339 --> 01:05:57.909
Lemkov's on his way back.

01:05:57.979 --> 01:05:59.504
Okay, you're on the clock.

01:05:59.659 --> 01:06:01.070
Three minutes, 37.

01:06:13.019 --> 01:06:14.783
Seal the elevators.

01:06:14.939 --> 01:06:16.543
No one goes in or out.

01:06:17.539 --> 01:06:18.540
Find Cherevin now!

01:06:22.659 --> 01:06:24.548
How advanced is your cirrhosis?

01:06:26.219 --> 01:06:27.550
You have a

01:06:28.899 --> 01:06:31.379
yellow tinge to your skin tone.

01:06:32.139 --> 01:06:34.540
Spider-web veins
on the backs of your hands.

01:06:35.819 --> 01:06:37.742
You're stage three, aren't you?

01:06:41.739 --> 01:06:43.229
You see? Now we're talking.

01:06:44.859 --> 01:06:47.146
- Excuse me.
- No, please take the call.

01:06:51.219 --> 01:06:52.983
They tell me I have
less than three months

01:06:53.059 --> 01:06:54.470
but you probably know that

01:06:54.539 --> 01:06:56.826
because you are clearly
a brilliant doctor.

01:07:08.739 --> 01:07:09.786
Jack.

01:07:09.899 --> 01:07:11.822
Hey, Teddy, it's Jack.
I'm in Cherevin's office

01:07:11.899 --> 01:07:13.947
- and I need your help really quick...
- I'm having dinner with her.

01:07:14.019 --> 01:07:15.020
What?

01:07:15.099 --> 01:07:16.624
Sarah in Arbitrage.

01:07:17.539 --> 01:07:20.019
That's great.
Look, I need a favor, Teddy.

01:07:20.099 --> 01:07:22.909
I'm at Cherevin.
I'm having a little trouble accessing

01:07:23.219 --> 01:07:25.904
a group file code without
a partner-level ABA dodge.

01:07:25.979 --> 01:07:27.390
Can you grab Rob for me?

01:07:27.499 --> 01:07:28.944
I know he's in a meeting right now.

01:07:29.019 --> 01:07:30.783
For you, the world.

01:07:34.459 --> 01:07:35.506
Jack!

01:07:35.699 --> 01:07:36.700
Hey, Rob.

01:07:36.779 --> 01:07:38.543
You find anything juicy over there?

01:07:38.619 --> 01:07:40.701
Oh, you know, accounts bullshit,

01:07:40.779 --> 01:07:42.299
hookers and hotels,
same old, same old.

01:07:42.339 --> 01:07:44.148
Did Teddy tell you
I need that dodge?

01:07:44.459 --> 01:07:46.621
I'll give it to you on one condition.

01:07:46.979 --> 01:07:48.026
Shoot

01:07:48.139 --> 01:07:52.303
If you get one whiff that FSB
is involved in whatever this is,

01:07:52.619 --> 01:07:55.350
you run, do not walk,
to the nearest airport.

01:07:56.059 --> 01:07:57.470
They play rough over there, Jack.

01:07:57.539 --> 01:07:59.507
Under two, Jack. Step it up.

01:07:59.699 --> 01:08:01.667
Understood. Yeah, understood, Rob.

01:08:01.739 --> 01:08:03.150
I worry about you, you know.

01:08:03.219 --> 01:08:06.225
Thanks. I appreciate it. Look, I'm a little
pressed for time on this end.

01:08:06.419 --> 01:08:07.989
- Ready?
- Yeah. Shoot.

01:08:09.899 --> 01:08:12.300
Four... One...

01:08:12.939 --> 01:08:14.100
Seven.

01:08:14.499 --> 01:08:15.739
You getting this?

01:08:15.819 --> 01:08:18.060
One... Eight...

01:08:18.619 --> 01:08:19.859
Three...

01:08:20.059 --> 01:08:21.185
Six.

01:08:28.779 --> 01:08:29.826
Jack?

01:08:30.179 --> 01:08:31.465
We're in.

01:08:31.819 --> 01:08:33.423
I'm not there yet. How we doing?

01:08:33.499 --> 01:08:35.149
Okay, unless he ran the red lights.

01:08:37.379 --> 01:08:38.460
Back on site.

01:08:38.539 --> 01:08:40.223
He ran the red lights. Get out.

01:08:53.419 --> 01:08:54.500
Got it! Got it!

01:09:05.299 --> 01:09:07.506
Jack? You got trouble.

01:09:08.939 --> 01:09:10.464
Oh, my God.

01:09:12.539 --> 01:09:13.779
Oh, my God.

01:09:14.379 --> 01:09:16.620
Main elevator is N.G.

01:09:16.699 --> 01:09:18.269
We're working on another exit.

01:09:18.979 --> 01:09:20.265
I need it now.

01:09:20.499 --> 01:09:21.910
Yep, yep, yep.

01:09:22.739 --> 01:09:24.070
There it is. Private elevator.

01:09:24.779 --> 01:09:26.907
Back of Cherevin's office. Go.

01:09:33.819 --> 01:09:35.821
Hit the service entrance button.

01:09:35.899 --> 01:09:39.221
Texting you Cyrillic icon now.

01:09:43.099 --> 01:09:44.942
There's an external staircase.

01:09:53.219 --> 01:09:54.425
Harper.

01:09:54.819 --> 01:09:55.820
Jack.

01:09:57.219 --> 01:09:58.300
Jack.

01:09:59.339 --> 01:10:01.068
Harper. Harper, can you hear me?

01:10:01.419 --> 01:10:02.659
Damn it.

01:10:10.339 --> 01:10:12.421
I'm flushed. Must be the wine.

01:10:12.539 --> 01:10:13.870
Or perhaps the company.

01:10:13.939 --> 01:10:16.146
- Are you about to misbehave?
- Would you like me to?

01:10:16.219 --> 01:10:17.630
I haven't decided yet.

01:10:21.579 --> 01:10:22.785
Telephone.

01:10:59.779 --> 01:11:01.019
Jack, stop.

01:11:07.579 --> 01:11:09.069
Hurry up, Jack. He's got Cathy

01:11:09.179 --> 01:11:10.990
and he's on his way
back to the building.

01:11:11.259 --> 01:11:12.340
Duck.

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:18.065
Keep moving, Jack.

01:11:18.179 --> 01:11:20.341
Staircase is clear
to the ground. Go.

01:11:22.179 --> 01:11:23.340
Control, you're on.

01:12:01.819 --> 01:12:03.025
Cathy.

01:12:05.539 --> 01:12:06.825
I'm so sorry.

01:12:07.739 --> 01:12:09.628
Did you enjoy your walk, Dr. Ryan?

01:12:09.739 --> 01:12:12.265
Mr. Cherevin, I have to apologize.
I had too much to drink.

01:12:12.339 --> 01:12:13.545
Excuse me, Doctor!

01:12:13.659 --> 01:12:14.740
- Yes?
- Yes?

01:12:15.979 --> 01:12:17.060
Viktor.

01:12:17.339 --> 01:12:18.784
Your wallet, let me see it.

01:12:19.939 --> 01:12:21.100
What is this?

01:12:29.819 --> 01:12:32.823
You missed a fascinating
conversation I had with Dr. Muller.

01:12:34.379 --> 01:12:36.108
I did? What was that?

01:12:36.219 --> 01:12:37.664
Things we regret.

01:12:38.219 --> 01:12:40.506
Let's you and I
have that same talk soon.

01:12:40.979 --> 01:12:43.744
You know, we should get home.
I am so sorry about tonight.

01:12:48.499 --> 01:12:49.546
Have them followed.

01:12:55.779 --> 01:12:57.190
Get us to Beta.

01:12:57.259 --> 01:12:59.102
Copy that. Let's hit the safe house.

01:12:59.179 --> 01:13:01.488
We clean the premises
and get the hell out of there.

01:13:04.379 --> 01:13:07.189
I have max-level data
coming in for analysis now.

01:13:12.579 --> 01:13:14.741
We are tracking them.

01:13:15.859 --> 01:13:18.146
The same old weaknesses, Viktor.

01:13:19.739 --> 01:13:20.979
Vodka,

01:13:22.579 --> 01:13:24.183
vanity,

01:13:25.459 --> 01:13:26.949
women.

01:13:31.419 --> 01:13:34.070
Your son would be ashamed.

01:13:38.219 --> 01:13:39.550
Ryan has it.

01:14:21.059 --> 01:14:23.141
The algorithm's uploading to Langley.

01:14:23.259 --> 01:14:24.260
Once we break it down...

01:14:24.339 --> 01:14:25.545
It's tomorrow.

01:14:27.179 --> 01:14:28.908
- What?
- The sell order.

01:14:29.179 --> 01:14:32.422
It's programmed for 9:06 a.m. Eastern Time.
They're dumping everywhere.

01:14:32.499 --> 01:14:34.740
Tokyo, London, Shanghai,
a dozen other exchanges.

01:14:34.819 --> 01:14:36.908
It's almost two trillion.
It's gonna be a wipeout.

01:14:37.019 --> 01:14:38.384
That's 18 hours.

01:14:39.899 --> 01:14:41.185
How do we stop it?

01:14:41.259 --> 01:14:44.547
They're not gonna flood the market
unless the terror attack is successful.

01:14:44.619 --> 01:14:45.859
They'd lose everything.

01:14:46.299 --> 01:14:48.620
And the attack will be coordinated
right before that,

01:14:48.699 --> 01:14:50.508
9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

01:15:03.219 --> 01:15:04.345
Get down!

01:15:07.339 --> 01:15:08.625
Go, go, go!

01:15:08.779 --> 01:15:11.020
Albatross, we are compromised
at rendezvous Beta.

01:15:11.099 --> 01:15:12.464
Request immediate backup.

01:15:20.779 --> 01:15:22.224
No! Get off me!

01:15:23.579 --> 01:15:24.580
Get off me!

01:15:24.659 --> 01:15:25.706
Jack!

01:15:26.059 --> 01:15:27.106
Cathy!

01:15:32.219 --> 01:15:33.300
Jack!

01:15:33.979 --> 01:15:35.105
Jack!

01:16:10.219 --> 01:16:11.666
I don't know what you're saying.

01:16:13.179 --> 01:16:14.180
Harper.

01:16:14.259 --> 01:16:16.068
Harper, can you hear me?
Do you have her?

01:16:16.139 --> 01:16:17.903
Are you sure she's wearing it?

01:16:17.979 --> 01:16:20.061
Yes! Of course!
I put it on her myself!

01:16:20.299 --> 01:16:22.063
We played the whole scene
for the driver.

01:16:22.139 --> 01:16:23.470
Now where is she?

01:16:29.179 --> 01:16:30.385
Got her.

01:16:30.539 --> 01:16:31.779
It's working.

01:16:31.859 --> 01:16:33.702
Jack, send me a ping from yours.

01:16:36.339 --> 01:16:39.661
Southwest on Kashirskoye Shosse.
It's a kilometer from you.

01:16:48.099 --> 01:16:49.783
Go! Go!

01:17:08.219 --> 01:17:09.220
Off the highway.

01:17:09.299 --> 01:17:11.381
Headed north toward Kuznetsky Most.

01:17:11.539 --> 01:17:13.462
Third exit ahead of you, due north.

01:17:33.019 --> 01:17:34.703
I hope you enjoyed your meal.

01:17:42.379 --> 01:17:43.426
Cathy.

01:17:43.739 --> 01:17:46.219
I hope for her sake
you have not yet transmitted

01:17:46.299 --> 01:17:48.267
the information you stole from me.

01:17:48.899 --> 01:17:51.789
I'm going to find you.
I'm going to find you.

01:17:54.299 --> 01:17:55.425
How far?

01:17:55.499 --> 01:17:57.627
Nine blocks behind him and closing.

01:17:58.779 --> 01:18:01.623
We haven't started transmitting yet.
I still have the stick drive.

01:18:04.819 --> 01:18:06.708
Very good, very good, Jack.

01:18:06.779 --> 01:18:09.589
Let us hope Cathy and I can believe you.

01:18:09.659 --> 01:18:12.822
If not, I have always found that
in these situations

01:18:12.899 --> 01:18:15.982
the swiftest results are achieved
by working with loved ones.

01:18:16.459 --> 01:18:19.144
You know I have what you want.
Put her on the phone!

01:18:19.499 --> 01:18:20.705
Doctor?

01:18:20.979 --> 01:18:21.980
Cathy!

01:18:22.059 --> 01:18:23.390
Talk to your fiancé.

01:18:23.579 --> 01:18:25.069
Cathy, talk to me!

01:18:26.419 --> 01:18:28.501
What? You think your...

01:18:28.819 --> 01:18:32.426
Silence is in some way heroic?

01:18:36.259 --> 01:18:37.465
Cathy!

01:18:37.539 --> 01:18:39.621
We will do this other way.

01:18:41.899 --> 01:18:45.267
So let me tell you something, Jack.

01:18:47.939 --> 01:18:52.627
If you squeeze a neck just right,

01:18:53.739 --> 01:18:56.140
human beings can't keep
their mouths closed.

01:18:59.219 --> 01:19:00.345
Jack.

01:19:00.419 --> 01:19:03.229
A light bulb will go into her mouth

01:19:03.579 --> 01:19:06.988
because in Lubyanka
and Lefortovo prisons,

01:19:07.059 --> 01:19:10.541
we discovered in torture
that vacuum glass explosion

01:19:10.659 --> 01:19:14.744
inside mouth causes damage to...

01:19:15.099 --> 01:19:17.909
Soft tissue, to enamel, to bone,

01:19:18.259 --> 01:19:21.502
and to lungs, also.

01:19:22.499 --> 01:19:25.150
It's quite a bit of, what do you say,

01:19:27.459 --> 01:19:30.190
havoc for forty watts.

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:31.864
Hard left coming up.

01:19:31.979 --> 01:19:33.424
Just two blocks and you got him.

01:19:33.499 --> 01:19:35.149
- Push it!
- I am!

01:19:37.019 --> 01:19:39.989
But when you look at this,
Cathy, you will know

01:19:40.059 --> 01:19:43.268
and, Jack, you will understand,
that I am very serious

01:19:43.339 --> 01:19:45.785
when I say that
I want what you stole from me

01:19:45.859 --> 01:19:47.509
and I want it now.

01:19:51.019 --> 01:19:53.750
Do you think Jack will get to you?

01:19:56.739 --> 01:20:00.630
Or do you think
he thinks it is a game?

01:20:08.619 --> 01:20:10.223
You think this is game, Jack?

01:20:10.299 --> 01:20:15.908
You think my country bled for so
many years before your feet for game?

01:20:23.139 --> 01:20:24.220
Cathy!

01:20:28.339 --> 01:20:30.990
You think my son died for game?

01:20:31.059 --> 01:20:33.266
You think I will
let myself die for nothing?

01:20:33.339 --> 01:20:34.864
No, it is America

01:20:34.939 --> 01:20:37.829
that will soon know
what it is to have nothing.

01:20:38.219 --> 01:20:39.505
He's got to cut back, Jack.

01:20:39.579 --> 01:20:41.980
You can catch him at the corner.
Run straight ahead.

01:20:43.699 --> 01:20:46.430
I put bulb in her mouth, Jack!

01:20:46.499 --> 01:20:50.504
Now, I have my hand
beneath your bitch chin!

01:20:50.859 --> 01:20:53.829
And now in moment,
I will crush her jaw

01:20:53.899 --> 01:20:57.267
so she bites down on it
and begins slow and painful death!

01:20:57.379 --> 01:20:58.904
So, I will say it once more,

01:20:59.019 --> 01:21:01.750
I want what you stole from me
and I want it now!

01:21:12.419 --> 01:21:14.945
Cathy!

01:21:18.859 --> 01:21:20.304
Come on! Let's go!

01:21:20.379 --> 01:21:22.029
- Let's go. You're all right.
- We need to go, now!

01:21:22.099 --> 01:21:23.180
Keep moving! We need to go!

01:21:23.219 --> 01:21:25.267
The attack is going to happen, Ryan!

01:21:25.379 --> 01:21:26.983
You can't stop it.

01:21:28.219 --> 01:21:29.300
Jack, we need to get out of here.

01:21:29.379 --> 01:21:30.540
The police are coming!

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:32.030
I got her!
She's in! She's in! She's in!

01:21:32.099 --> 01:21:34.022
Turn it on! Let's move! Let's move!

01:21:58.499 --> 01:22:00.149
Okay. Here's what we have.

01:22:00.219 --> 01:22:03.860
Aleksandr Borovsky,
AKA Andrew Bornstein, age 23.

01:22:03.979 --> 01:22:05.868
Last known address,
in Dearborn, Michigan.

01:22:06.299 --> 01:22:08.142
Move, move, move!

01:22:08.459 --> 01:22:09.540
- Let's go!
- Going in.

01:22:09.619 --> 01:22:10.666
Cover my six!

01:22:12.139 --> 01:22:14.426
The location's burned.
They're up and out recently.

01:22:14.499 --> 01:22:15.500
They leave anything?

01:22:15.579 --> 01:22:17.183
Ashes and melted plastic.

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:19.506
FBI was tipped that
he might be a sleeper agent.

01:22:23.019 --> 01:22:24.828
A sleeper agent who was handpicked.

01:22:24.939 --> 01:22:26.270
This guy was groomed for it.

01:22:26.339 --> 01:22:27.625
This is personal.

01:22:29.139 --> 01:22:30.982
Wait a minute. Cherevin's son.

01:22:31.059 --> 01:22:32.106
What?

01:22:32.179 --> 01:22:35.103
Last night, Cherevin mentioned
something about his son

01:22:35.179 --> 01:22:36.943
having died.
What if he didn't?

01:22:37.019 --> 01:22:39.147
Cross-referencing Moscow
hospital records,

01:22:39.219 --> 01:22:40.903
coroner's reports. Got it!

01:22:40.979 --> 01:22:42.868
Aleksandr Cherevin, age nine.

01:22:42.939 --> 01:22:44.782
Apparently died in a drowning accident,

01:22:44.859 --> 01:22:47.942
June 2004. Cherevin's own signature
is on the certificate.

01:22:48.019 --> 01:22:51.182
Aleksandr Borovsky entered the country
in '04 with his parents.

01:22:51.379 --> 01:22:52.824
Aleksandr Cherevin, age nine,

01:22:52.899 --> 01:22:54.788
and Aleksandr Borovsky, age nine.

01:22:54.859 --> 01:22:56.065
They're the same kid.

01:22:56.179 --> 01:22:58.705
He took a cash advance of $6,000.

01:22:58.819 --> 01:23:00.389
- And then he went black?
- Right.

01:23:00.499 --> 01:23:02.228
By now, he could be anywhere.

01:23:10.299 --> 01:23:12.779
Hey, Al. Where you been?

01:23:12.899 --> 01:23:14.060
You in some kind of shit?

01:23:14.139 --> 01:23:16.487
FBI was crawling
all over here yesterday looking for you.

01:23:21.419 --> 01:23:24.070
Wait. The guy knew that
the FBI made his phone.

01:23:24.179 --> 01:23:26.022
He would dump it, right?
He'd dump it.

01:23:26.539 --> 01:23:29.224
Michigan Bell.
Is there a listing near his house?

01:23:29.299 --> 01:23:30.505
Bear with me.

01:23:31.579 --> 01:23:32.546
Off-site delivery?

01:23:32.619 --> 01:23:34.144
There's a way into him, I know it.

01:23:34.219 --> 01:23:36.267
- We just got to find it.
- All right, drive safe.

01:23:40.539 --> 01:23:42.940
That fake death certificate,
pull it up again.

01:23:43.219 --> 01:23:45.506
Cherevin couldn't do this alone.

01:23:46.019 --> 01:23:47.509
That second signature right there.

01:23:47.579 --> 01:23:49.388
The attending physician,
Mikhail Yureyovich,

01:23:49.459 --> 01:23:51.063
emigrated to the U.S. in '08.

01:23:51.139 --> 01:23:53.141
Attained U.S. citizenship
two years later.

01:23:53.219 --> 01:23:55.267
Give me his Social Security number.

01:23:56.539 --> 01:23:58.860
377 - 31 - 8622.

01:23:58.939 --> 01:24:00.782
Perfect. You have that?

01:24:00.859 --> 01:24:03.100
The doctor served
with Cherevin in Afghanistan.

01:24:03.179 --> 01:24:06.228
It looks like he's been subsidized
for years by Cherevin's firm.

01:24:06.299 --> 01:24:08.666
He's got at least four offshore accounts.

01:24:08.779 --> 01:24:09.985
Found the pay phone!

01:24:10.059 --> 01:24:11.709
- Six blocks away.
- Let me see.

01:24:11.779 --> 01:24:13.429
They ran it, but it didn't cross
with anything.

01:24:13.499 --> 01:24:15.627
All right. All right. Here, here.

01:24:15.699 --> 01:24:18.020
Someone called a pay phone
in Pennsylvania

01:24:18.099 --> 01:24:20.625
from the pay phone
nearest to his house.

01:24:20.699 --> 01:24:21.860
Pennsylvania... Pennsylvania...

01:24:21.939 --> 01:24:23.219
Pennsylvania... Seventeen calls.

01:24:23.259 --> 01:24:24.784
That's it! That's it. That's it.

01:24:24.939 --> 01:24:28.830
We're searching for recent
nonresidential real estate transactions

01:24:28.979 --> 01:24:30.549
made by Yureyovich.

01:24:30.779 --> 01:24:32.383
Like a warehouse or storage facility.

01:24:32.459 --> 01:24:36.180
Got it. Barn at 211 Swallowsdale Road
and same zip code as the pay phone.

01:24:36.259 --> 01:24:39.581
Sold six months ago
to Dr. Mikhail Yureyovich. All cash.

01:24:42.099 --> 01:24:43.669
He's in Pennsylvania.

01:24:45.259 --> 01:24:47.466
Nobody blows up Pennsylvania, Jack.

01:24:47.619 --> 01:24:49.508
Tom, he's in Pennsylvania.

01:24:59.779 --> 01:25:01.508
You're going to Pennsylvania.

01:25:01.579 --> 01:25:03.502
That's right. Get FBI to that barn.

01:25:03.579 --> 01:25:05.661
I need people there now. Thank you.

01:25:17.659 --> 01:25:19.582
We still don't know
where the attack's gonna come, Jack.

01:25:19.659 --> 01:25:22.742
If Borovsky's on the move, we need
to know where the hell he's going.

01:25:22.819 --> 01:25:25.629
Cell phone triangulation.
Where does this guy travel to?

01:25:25.699 --> 01:25:27.747
- Where has he gone?
- Michigan, Michigan.

01:25:27.819 --> 01:25:29.184
Michigan. He hasn't been anywhere.

01:25:29.259 --> 01:25:31.944
Bullshit! We're not digging hard enough!

01:25:32.019 --> 01:25:34.021
Everybody goes somewhere.

01:25:36.379 --> 01:25:37.619
It's his parents.

01:25:37.699 --> 01:25:39.303
They're a unit, right? They're a unit.

01:25:39.379 --> 01:25:42.462
If he didn't travel somewhere,
maybe they did. Where did they go?

01:25:42.539 --> 01:25:44.303
Did they post pictures online?

01:25:44.379 --> 01:25:46.620
No, no, no. They wouldn't do that.
They're too smart for that.

01:25:46.699 --> 01:25:48.303
We're looking for extended family.

01:25:48.379 --> 01:25:50.063
Look for extended family.

01:25:50.219 --> 01:25:54.304
Oh, did they hit anybody's Instagram,
Facebook, Hopscotch? Reddit?

01:25:54.379 --> 01:25:55.540
Nope, none.

01:25:55.619 --> 01:25:56.905
Here. Image Looker.

01:25:56.979 --> 01:25:59.220
An uncle in New York.
Borovsky's father

01:25:59.299 --> 01:26:03.190
accessed the account
from his phone four times, right here.

01:26:03.259 --> 01:26:05.387
Put it up on the main screen.
Get it up.

01:26:07.379 --> 01:26:09.143
They're going to hit Manhattan.

01:26:09.539 --> 01:26:10.904
Jesus.

01:26:11.699 --> 01:26:13.667
Our guy never went to New York.

01:26:14.059 --> 01:26:15.823
He had someone scout it for him.

01:26:16.219 --> 01:26:18.028
And they posted the pictures

01:26:18.219 --> 01:26:20.028
so he could plan the attack.

01:26:28.619 --> 01:26:30.269
Wait, wait, stop.

01:26:30.779 --> 01:26:32.110
Back up.

01:26:34.099 --> 01:26:35.464
There, that.

01:26:40.499 --> 01:26:42.183
You know that building?

01:26:42.659 --> 01:26:45.390
- Jack works there. It's Wall Street.
- Oh, Jesus.

01:26:46.099 --> 01:26:48.147
An attack on downtown Manhattan.

01:26:50.579 --> 01:26:51.740
I'd say that'd start a panic.

01:26:58.939 --> 01:27:00.589
Get me Harper.

01:27:00.659 --> 01:27:01.865
Feds just uncovered evidence

01:27:01.939 --> 01:27:04.704
suggesting he camouflaged
a van stolen from work.

01:27:04.779 --> 01:27:06.781
Discarded tags,
auto paint, paint thinner.

01:27:18.979 --> 01:27:20.663
Tire tracks indicate we're looking for

01:27:20.739 --> 01:27:23.709
a Ford Econoline,
white or blue body, long wheel base.

01:27:23.819 --> 01:27:26.550
Tell FBI we can be at the site
in ten minutes.

01:27:26.619 --> 01:27:28.428
Dr. Muller, there's a car
to take you home.

01:27:28.499 --> 01:27:29.500
An agent will stay with you.

01:27:29.619 --> 01:27:31.906
No. Take me to Lennox Hill Hospital.
They might need me.

01:27:31.979 --> 01:27:33.026
If I don't make it back...

01:27:33.139 --> 01:27:35.221
Look. I will see you tonight.
We're having dinner.

01:27:35.299 --> 01:27:37.666
And we're gonna split the check.

01:27:37.739 --> 01:27:40.868
Sir? Excuse me.
The chopper is ready.

01:27:46.859 --> 01:27:48.623
Have you been in one since?

01:27:48.699 --> 01:27:50.588
Don't worry about me.

01:27:51.259 --> 01:27:52.704
I haven't yet.

01:28:22.499 --> 01:28:23.910
Move! Bomb disposal going in!

01:28:24.259 --> 01:28:26.182
- Hold on!
- Get back, get back!

01:28:27.299 --> 01:28:29.779
The market has opened in New York,
Mr. Cherevin.

01:28:29.859 --> 01:28:32.749
Margin calls from creditors
are imminent. Do we sell?

01:28:32.819 --> 01:28:33.866
Not yet.

01:28:34.099 --> 01:28:36.784
Please proceed as directed by officers.

01:28:37.219 --> 01:28:39.108
I repeat, a total evacuation...

01:28:40.539 --> 01:28:41.620
Jesus Christ.

01:28:43.299 --> 01:28:45.347
Emergency vehicles only

01:28:45.419 --> 01:28:47.228
are allowed access
beyond this perimeter.

01:28:50.819 --> 01:28:52.184
Emergency vehicles only...

01:28:52.259 --> 01:28:54.500
We got a dozen ESU trucks
coming in right now.

01:28:54.619 --> 01:28:56.621
I put the alert out
to the FBI and Counterterrorism

01:28:56.699 --> 01:28:59.543
to expand the EBU's search
to a 30-block radius.

01:28:59.619 --> 01:29:01.064
No, this isn't right.

01:29:01.139 --> 01:29:03.301
I repeat, emergency vehicles only

01:29:03.419 --> 01:29:06.229
are allowed access
beyond this perimeter.

01:29:22.419 --> 01:29:24.660
I want air traffic shut down
over the city.

01:29:27.179 --> 01:29:29.102
Emergency vehicles only

01:29:29.179 --> 01:29:31.181
are allowed access
beyond this perimeter.

01:29:42.779 --> 01:29:43.780
Harper!

01:29:44.019 --> 01:29:45.259
Harper!

01:29:47.259 --> 01:29:48.545
Harper!

01:29:51.619 --> 01:29:52.780
Teddy!

01:29:53.419 --> 01:29:55.148
- Teddy.
- Jack! I thought you were in Moscow.

01:29:55.219 --> 01:29:56.630
I was. I need the bike.

01:29:56.699 --> 01:29:57.780
Jack!

01:29:59.739 --> 01:30:02.265
We recommend immediate
execution of sell orders.

01:30:02.339 --> 01:30:03.340
Wait.

01:30:14.139 --> 01:30:15.300
Jack.

01:30:15.459 --> 01:30:17.029
- I got him!
- Jack, where are you?

01:30:17.099 --> 01:30:18.100
It's a diversion!

01:30:18.179 --> 01:30:19.305
The painting in Cherevin's office,

01:30:19.379 --> 01:30:21.859
it's right out of Napoleon's playbook.
It's Waterloo!

01:30:21.939 --> 01:30:23.703
He's not going to the building,

01:30:23.779 --> 01:30:24.826
he's going under it!

01:30:26.139 --> 01:30:27.140
Jack?

01:30:39.659 --> 01:30:40.660
Jack!

01:30:41.659 --> 01:30:44.539
I need a cross-section of what's
underneath this building. I need it now.

01:30:59.059 --> 01:31:01.869
The greatest upward blast amplification,
where would it be?

01:31:01.939 --> 01:31:03.429
The convection chimney. Here.

01:31:03.539 --> 01:31:05.303
If the force of the blast
is channeled up through it,

01:31:05.379 --> 01:31:07.866
you're looking at shock over pressure,
six or seven buildings come down.

01:31:07.939 --> 01:31:09.543
Jesus. That's half of Wall Street.

01:31:56.299 --> 01:31:57.710
Let's get this thing up!

01:31:58.739 --> 01:32:00.423
Come on, clear the area!
We got to move!

01:32:00.579 --> 01:32:01.910
Open it.

01:32:02.179 --> 01:32:03.819
Secure the ropes. We're going down!

01:32:33.179 --> 01:32:34.704
Oh, God, no.

01:32:42.459 --> 01:32:44.746
Trading is about to be suspended
in New York.

01:32:45.379 --> 01:32:47.381
Mr. Cherevin, we need to act now.

01:32:48.779 --> 01:32:50.702
Please... Aleksandr.

01:33:25.659 --> 01:33:27.980
Where are you, Jack?
I've got people coming to you!

01:33:35.779 --> 01:33:37.065
We got nothing here, Harper!

01:33:45.619 --> 01:33:46.620
Jack.

01:33:46.699 --> 01:33:49.384
The sell-off's programmed for 9:06,
that's two minutes from now.

01:33:49.459 --> 01:33:51.700
Harper, we're not talking about 10
or 15,000 people.

01:33:51.779 --> 01:33:52.940
More like 100,000.

01:33:53.179 --> 01:33:55.022
Just get me a clear path to the water!

01:33:55.379 --> 01:33:57.029
Head north on Front Street.

01:35:49.379 --> 01:35:51.427
Sorokin wants to meet you now.

01:36:10.259 --> 01:36:12.944
It was always for Russia.

01:36:13.899 --> 01:36:15.060
So is this.

01:37:23.859 --> 01:37:27.068
You didn't pick this life. I did.

01:37:32.619 --> 01:37:34.189
But I picked you.

01:37:37.739 --> 01:37:39.070
I can't even kiss you.

01:37:39.579 --> 01:37:40.819
- Yeah, you can.
- That side?

01:37:40.899 --> 01:37:43.630
- It doesn't hurt that much.
- Really? You sure?

01:37:58.939 --> 01:38:02.182
Commander Harper? Dr. Ryan?
They're ready for you.

01:38:04.099 --> 01:38:06.101
Direct. Clear.

01:38:06.899 --> 01:38:10.540
Concise. If he doesn't ask,
he doesn't want to know.

01:38:10.739 --> 01:38:11.820
Yeah.

01:38:12.779 --> 01:38:14.065
Okay.

01:38:15.819 --> 01:38:19.460
Any way you can get that boy-scout-
on-a-field-trip look off your face?

01:38:19.819 --> 01:38:21.423
Not a chance.

01:38:24.099 --> 01:38:26.306
That's what I like about you.

01:38:32.819 --> 01:38:34.821
Harper, when do you ever sleep?

01:38:34.899 --> 01:38:36.389
You know what, don't answer that.

01:38:36.699 --> 01:38:39.748
I kind of like the idea that you don't.
Let me keep thinking it.

01:38:42.539 --> 01:38:44.143
And what's your name, son?

01:38:44.499 --> 01:38:48.140
Ryan, Mr. President. Jack Ryan.

01:38:51.065 --> 01:38:55.065
