You see things better than most.

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:31.480
I trust the things unseen
more than the seen.

00:04:33.816 --> 00:04:35.692
Is Lunan your granddaughter?

00:04:35.693 --> 00:04:41.365
I found her in the forest.
Cleft lip babies are thought cursed.

00:04:41.991 --> 00:04:44.159
You saved her life.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.666
You gave her a new life.
I thank you on behalf of Lunan.

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:53.294
I just did what I should.

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:04.013
Is there anything

00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:09.018
Dearly wish for?

Enjoyed it?

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.881

When? After I die?

00:07:15.811 --> 00:07:18.856

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:44.964
It's from before.
I'm fine.

00:07:44.965 --> 00:07:47.383

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:48.759

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.178
Why you!

00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:53.849
A doctor shouldn't hurt
his hand.

00:07:54.558 --> 00:07:55.684
Yeon-a.

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:58.227
How long were we apart?

00:07:58.228 --> 00:07:59.312
1 minute.

00:07:59.313 --> 00:08:00.731
That long?

00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:03.358
Kiss me.

00:08:07.738 --> 00:08:09.822
Why here? 'Cuz of people?

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:11.408

- Me too.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.387

You're still here!

00:08:35.224 --> 00:08:37.142
What about your show?

00:08:38.477 --> 00:08:41.562
I forgot to say
something important.

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:42.647
What?

00:08:42.648 --> 00:08:46.776
<i>Passengers on the 5:30 train to Busan...</i>

00:08:49.321 --> 00:08:50.947
Let's go.

00:08:50.948 --> 00:08:53.158
Just tell me?

00:08:54.493 --> 00:08:56.078
Is something wrong?

00:08:57.329 --> 00:09:02.166
Male dolphins cannot mate
on its own.

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:06.754
So other males help him
to mate with the female.

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:08.006
I think...

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.801
You're like the male dolphin.

00:09:11.802 --> 00:09:13.636
What do you mean?

00:09:13.637 --> 00:09:16.514
You need help from others.

00:09:16.515 --> 00:09:19.101
<i>The train to Busan will soon depart.</i>

00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:21.144

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:26.191
I want your baby!

00:09:28.402 --> 00:09:31.571
- So assertive!
- I want a baby too!

00:09:31.572 --> 00:09:34.324
What are you saying?
Have a baby here?

00:09:38.287 --> 00:09:40.122
I'll call when I arrive.

00:09:41.373 --> 00:09:43.874

00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:44.876
Bye.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.598
- Looks like it didn't go well.
- It did.

00:09:58.599 --> 00:10:00.725
He wants to get married?

00:10:00.726 --> 00:10:02.476
Of course.

00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:03.729
Good!

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:13.780
Dept. of Marine Animals.

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:19.660

00:10:19.661 --> 00:10:21.204
I'll send it.

00:10:32.591 --> 00:10:34.508
What's this?

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:38.638
Kids asked to have it raised
with its friends.

00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:41.223
Kids watch too many cartoons.

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:42.308
So cute.

00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:44.603
This is no daycare.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.348
Are you alright?

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:17.838

Sir?

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:57.420

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:09.390

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:16.105
Yes.

00:14:16.106 --> 00:14:19.066
You were in there long.
We were worried.

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:20.569
I'm sorry.

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:25.198
Excuse me.

00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:05.363
Hi.

00:15:05.364 --> 00:15:06.739
Busy?

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:07.781
What's up?

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:11.035
Just stopped by to see
if you got back okay.

00:15:11.036 --> 00:15:12.912
I had a good time.

00:15:12.913 --> 00:15:14.747
No trouble without me?

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:18.208
You're one to talk.
You caused havoc here!

00:15:18.209 --> 00:15:21.295
We were busy covering
your surgeries and lectures!

00:15:21.296 --> 00:15:23.380
Always thankful.

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:26.467
Then buy me dinner?

00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:28.135
Why not?

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:29.429
What is it?

00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:32.097
Another surgery?

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:33.725
How much time left?

00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:36.602
The tumor is over 5cm.

00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:39.813
Looks like it spread
to the liver too.

00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:42.983
It's terminal lung cancer.
I give it 6 months.

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:44.777
If it was a friend,
what would you say?

00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:46.779
What's to say?

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.574
I'd just help prepare him
to die well.

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:53.577
- I thought so.
- Who is it?

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:54.912
Your bossom buddy?

00:15:54.913 --> 00:15:56.206
Tae-ho?

00:15:57.749 --> 00:16:00.334
He'll outlive us by 50 years.

00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:02.795
Oh no! He'll flip!

00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:05.839
Sorry! I gotta go.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:11.512
Running away again?
No date, huh?

00:16:11.513 --> 00:16:13.138
I promise next time.

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:14.474
Hold on!

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:18.811
Could you get this analyzed?

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:20.397
What is it?

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:27.695
Crazy? What if the blind gramps
gave you something bad?

00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:31.240
What doctor takes strange pills
like that?

00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:34.368
- It was so real.
- It's a hallucinogen.

00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:37.080
Like the pills people take
before bungee jumping.

00:16:38.373 --> 00:16:39.666
Whatever.

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:45.046
All you do is work 24/7,
you must've gone crazy!

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.381
How was it?

00:16:47.382 --> 00:16:49.050
Seeing yourself then?

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.845
Good looking and young.

00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:54.305
Why you!

00:16:56.349 --> 00:17:03.690
This beach was hot back then
filled with pretty gals!

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.739
They loved me!
Wonder how they're living.

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.742
Joo-hong was hot.

00:17:14.743 --> 00:17:17.327
And Mi-sun.

00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:20.415
- But not Choon-nam.
- You remember their names?

00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:26.503
If you meet him again,
tell him to get married.

00:17:26.504 --> 00:17:29.298
A smelly bachelor
your whole life...

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:30.759
If I go back...

00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:38.099
Think I can see her?

00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:40.226
Yeon-a.

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:43.104
You serious?

00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:45.648
Get over it.

00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:49.194
It's been over 30 years.

00:17:50.612 --> 00:17:56.033
If you can meet her at will,
it'd be a miracle!

00:17:56.034 --> 00:17:57.493
Crazy fool.

00:17:57.494 --> 00:18:00.204
Lady! I'll get it!

00:18:00.205 --> 00:18:01.790
Oh yes!

00:18:06.628 --> 00:18:08.129
Crazy!

00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:10.172
Nice!

00:18:10.173 --> 00:18:11.173
Tae-ho!

00:18:11.174 --> 00:18:13.801
What's so important
to call me out here?

00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:14.969
Catch.

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:17.638
What's this?

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:20.599
I'll move to Jeju to farm this.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.267
Why's a tangerine so big?

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:23.393
Cool, huh?

00:18:23.394 --> 00:18:29.149
It's a Japanese Dekopon.
A mix of tangerine and orange.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:32.611
If I import and grow this,
I'll hit the jackpot.

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:34.738
I even made a name for it.

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:36.616
Orange-tangerine!

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:39.327
Just stick to your job, pal.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.332
Did something happen in Seoul?

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.673
Yeon-a wants to have a baby.

00:18:52.674 --> 00:18:54.008
All of a sudden?

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:57.010
Lucky fool.

00:18:57.011 --> 00:18:58.512
Yeon-a is great!

00:18:58.513 --> 00:19:05.435
Rather than wait for you,
she'll throw you on the bed first?

00:19:05.436 --> 00:19:06.854
Lucky you.

00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:08.856
7 years is a long time to wait.

00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:09.898
Congratulations man!

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:13.402
I don't plan on having any kids.

00:19:13.403 --> 00:19:15.363
I decided that long ago.

00:19:16.156 --> 00:19:20.034
If I was a girl,
I'd marry you too.

00:19:21.452 --> 00:19:23.162
- You'll marry me?
- Sure.

00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:25.039
- Crazy!
- Why not!

00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:29.668
By the way...

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:32.296
- I met someone strange last night.
- Pretty?

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:34.673
- A man.
- Not interested.

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:37.092
He seemed familiar
for some reason.

00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:39.887
Probably a patient.

00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:42.973
Then I'd remember.
His name's the same.

00:19:42.974 --> 00:19:45.100
Asked my name
then said he's HAN Soo-hyun.

00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:47.269
He must be a psycho.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:50.230
His nose bled badly
so I followed him to the bathroom.

00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:52.941
- And?
- He disappeared.

00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:55.861
- Some magician?
- Really! He vanished!

00:19:55.862 --> 00:19:58.197
Must've seen it wrong.

00:19:58.198 --> 00:20:00.324
Must've, right?

00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:02.367
- I'm off.
- Soo-hyun!

00:20:02.368 --> 00:20:03.077
What?

00:20:03.078 --> 00:20:08.248
That gal with big boobs
keeps looking at me.

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:12.169
She's sending me signals.
See her winking?

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.296
Then I should wink back!

00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:17.716
How do I look?
Should I go to her?

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:19.092
- Tae-ho?
- What?

00:20:19.093 --> 00:20:21.929
That Orangerine
you talked about...

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.057
Do it. It'll work.

00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:27.434
Orangerine?

00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:29.395
You're a genius!

00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:54.212
SOO-A

00:20:57.966 --> 00:20:59.801
- My girl!
- <i>Hi, Dad!</i>

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:01.969
It's been ages.
Where are you?

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.263
<i>The library.
Is something wrong?</i>

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:08.225
Of course not.
Just wanted to talk to you.

00:21:08.226 --> 00:21:09.601
<i>About what?</i>

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:11.311
Why you!

00:21:11.312 --> 00:21:13.730
Are you eating right?

00:21:13.731 --> 00:21:15.942
<i>Of course! And you?</i>

00:21:15.984 --> 00:21:19.027
Daddy eats well.

00:21:19.028 --> 00:21:21.572
<i>Don't skip meals
'cuz I'm not there!</i>

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:25.325
I hear a man's voice.

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:27.786
Where the hell are you?

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:31.791
<i>What's with you?
Hang up if you're going to nag.</i>

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.422
<i>Caught a cold?</i>

00:21:38.256 --> 00:21:40.257
Something's in my throat.

00:21:40.258 --> 00:21:44.219
<i>I'll be home soon
after my exams.</i>

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.721
<i>Let's talk in person.</i>

00:21:45.722 --> 00:21:47.348
See you then.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.718
Nine left.

00:22:27.764 --> 00:22:29.891
I'll die soon anyway.

00:22:56.542 --> 00:22:58.586
- Geeze!
- Oh my!

00:22:59.796 --> 00:23:01.630
- Why'd you come?
- Here.

00:23:01.631 --> 00:23:02.548
What's this?

00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:05.385
Let's start building one by one.

00:23:05.927 --> 00:23:07.928
You came down here for this?

00:23:07.929 --> 00:23:09.930
Cute, huh? Our family!

00:23:09.931 --> 00:23:11.599
I've never raised a dog.

00:23:11.641 --> 00:23:13.266
It's okay.

00:23:13.267 --> 00:23:14.768
I gotta catch my train.

00:23:14.769 --> 00:23:15.936
You're leaving?

00:23:15.937 --> 00:23:18.730
I don't want to,
but I got a morning show.

00:23:18.731 --> 00:23:20.107
Don't go.

00:23:20.108 --> 00:23:21.733
You two get along.

00:23:21.734 --> 00:23:22.527
Take care.

00:23:22.528 --> 00:23:24.361
I've never raised a puppy!

00:23:24.362 --> 00:23:25.987
You're really leaving?

00:23:25.988 --> 00:23:28.323
- Busan Station, please.
- I can't raise a dog.

00:23:28.324 --> 00:23:30.784
Animals and people are the same.

00:23:30.785 --> 00:23:33.495
Watch carefully and you'll know
what they want.

00:23:33.496 --> 00:23:34.622
Don't go.

00:23:34.956 --> 00:23:38.334
<i>POTATOES</i>

00:23:38.668 --> 00:23:42.463
What now? This is nuts.

00:23:44.298 --> 00:23:47.968
Your name's Potato from now on.

00:23:47.969 --> 00:23:49.220
Eat this.

00:24:06.154 --> 00:24:07.530
Let's sleep.

00:24:38.603 --> 00:24:41.354
I made it? I'm here?

00:24:41.355 --> 00:24:43.649
Who's there?

00:24:46.903 --> 00:24:48.905
There's nothing to take so...

00:24:57.288 --> 00:24:59.290
May 30th, 1985?

00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:01.708
Exactly 30 years.

00:25:01.709 --> 00:25:05.462
You're the man from
Busan Station, right?

00:25:05.463 --> 00:25:08.590
Clean up!
You moved in long ago.

00:25:08.591 --> 00:25:11.219
How'd you come to my house?

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.386
'Cuz it's my house too.

00:25:13.387 --> 00:25:18.725
Don't touch anything!
Get the hell out now!

00:25:18.726 --> 00:25:21.394
You still don't know who I am?

00:25:21.395 --> 00:25:23.189
How would I know?

00:25:25.233 --> 00:25:26.650
Are you a patient?

00:25:26.651 --> 00:25:29.862
Not a patient
but a pediatric surgeon.

00:25:31.364 --> 00:25:34.158
I'm a pediatric surgery resident.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.788
Must be a psychiatric patient.
What's your name?

00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:42.958
I told you it's HAN Soo-hyun.

00:25:42.959 --> 00:25:45.085
This is insane!

00:25:45.086 --> 00:25:49.799
Give me your ID.
I'll call to get you help.

00:25:53.886 --> 00:25:54.762
<i>HAN Soo-hyun</i>

00:25:54.763 --> 00:25:56.556
Haven't seen this TV in so long!

00:25:58.099 --> 00:25:59.267
Sir?

00:25:59.934 --> 00:26:01.018
Here.

00:26:02.353 --> 00:26:05.772
What kind of joke is this?

00:26:05.773 --> 00:26:09.150
Come on!
Issued in year 2008?

00:26:09.151 --> 00:26:11.487
Potato? It's you!

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:16.450
Long time no see Potato!

00:26:22.957 --> 00:26:24.417
How do you know its name?

00:26:25.876 --> 00:26:27.545
'Cuz I named him.

00:26:30.298 --> 00:26:34.844
I know it's hard to believe.
To be honest, I still don't.

00:26:35.761 --> 00:26:39.557
But you're me 30 years ago
and I'm you 30 years later.

00:26:40.224 --> 00:26:42.309
<i>That makes no sense.</i>

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:44.854
Makes sense I vanished from
that bathroom?

00:26:55.823 --> 00:26:57.490
What the hell!

00:26:57.491 --> 00:26:59.367
- Want a taste from the future?
- No!

00:26:59.368 --> 00:27:01.620
If you don't leave,
I'll call the cops.

00:27:01.621 --> 00:27:04.373
The cops? You mean Tae-ho?

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:11.838
You can't believe this.
I understand.

00:27:11.839 --> 00:27:14.216
We're all believers in science.

00:27:15.176 --> 00:27:20.680
But as you get older,
the belief fades.

00:27:20.681 --> 00:27:21.890
Please just leave now.

00:27:21.891 --> 00:27:24.309
Will you believe
if I say a secret only we know?

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:25.853
What secret?

00:27:27.229 --> 00:27:29.147
I don't have any secrets, sir.

00:27:29.148 --> 00:27:31.483
There's one.

00:27:31.484 --> 00:27:33.777
A secret we didn't tell anyone.

00:27:33.778 --> 00:27:34.987
What?

00:27:41.452 --> 00:27:44.079
We got beaten by Dad a lot.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.705
When he got drunk.

00:27:45.706 --> 00:27:48.918
Thought hiding it
was helping Mom.

00:27:52.213 --> 00:27:56.549
You're scared
to get hurt like that again.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:59.219
- Or to hurt others.
- Shut up!

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.305
Why'd you move to Busan
as soon as Mom passed away?

00:28:02.306 --> 00:28:04.933
You wanted to forget.

00:28:04.934 --> 00:28:08.771
But think about
who helped you forget it all.

00:28:10.523 --> 00:28:11.899
Who are you?

00:28:14.694 --> 00:28:15.653
HAN Soo-hyun.

00:28:15.654 --> 00:28:17.822
What do you want from me?

00:28:20.241 --> 00:28:22.075
Nothing.

00:28:22.076 --> 00:28:24.577
Just want to see her once.

00:28:24.578 --> 00:28:25.995
Yeon-a.

00:28:25.996 --> 00:28:27.915
What the hell do you mean?

00:28:30.543 --> 00:28:31.919
Come back!

00:28:47.017 --> 00:28:50.270
Stay the hell away from Yeon-a!

00:28:50.271 --> 00:28:51.689
Or I'll kill you!

00:29:29.351 --> 00:29:31.311
Tae-ho! Open up!

00:29:31.312 --> 00:29:32.146
It's Soo-hyun!

00:29:32.147 --> 00:29:33.397
What is it?

00:29:34.023 --> 00:29:36.941
Hey, wait!

00:29:36.942 --> 00:29:38.610
Listen to me.

00:29:38.611 --> 00:29:40.780
Are you sick?

00:29:44.158 --> 00:29:45.408
It's totally unimaginable!

00:29:45.409 --> 00:29:47.911
Can't you see what I'm doing?

00:29:47.912 --> 00:29:49.287
Honey?

00:29:49.288 --> 00:29:50.789
Who is it?

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:53.708
Don't mind him, baby!
I'll send him off!

00:29:53.709 --> 00:29:56.295
- Go home.
- Busan Station!

00:29:57.087 --> 00:29:58.296
That man appeared again!

00:29:58.297 --> 00:29:59.839
The psycho? See ya.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.841
He barged into my house.

00:30:01.842 --> 00:30:03.843
He says he's me 30 years later!

00:30:03.844 --> 00:30:06.513
Okay, man.
Let's talk tomorrow!

00:30:06.514 --> 00:30:08.182
He even knows...

00:30:09.975 --> 00:30:12.645
He knows that you're a cop.

00:30:13.604 --> 00:30:18.984
He said he'll meet Yeon-a,
then vanished!

00:30:20.236 --> 00:30:21.779
12 o'clock...

00:30:25.157 --> 00:30:26.408
20 minutes.

00:30:27.993 --> 00:30:31.580
I stayed there 20 minutes.

00:30:43.592 --> 00:30:46.219
Fingerprint matching is not easy.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.681
TV shows make it look
way easier than it is.

00:30:49.682 --> 00:30:52.058
Then compare it
with my fingerprints.

00:30:52.059 --> 00:30:53.476
You don't believe him do you?

00:30:53.477 --> 00:30:56.396
It says it was made in 2000.

00:30:56.397 --> 00:30:57.564
That's weird.

00:30:57.565 --> 00:31:00.149
No, that's the price! 2,000 Won!

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:02.110
Wait!

00:31:02.111 --> 00:31:03.903
It's all filled out.

00:31:03.904 --> 00:31:05.406
Thank you.

00:31:08.367 --> 00:31:11.911
Worried about your girl,
you drag me out at this hour!

00:31:11.912 --> 00:31:15.081
But I was with Sun-young!

00:31:15.082 --> 00:31:17.710
Things were good.

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.547
Did you call Yeon-a?

00:31:22.423 --> 00:31:23.423
Yeon-a...

00:31:23.424 --> 00:31:26.050
Can't use the phone here.

00:31:26.051 --> 00:31:29.846
Don't worry!
It's just a crazy man's scam.

00:31:29.847 --> 00:31:31.891
I'll get you some water.

00:31:36.103 --> 00:31:37.021
<i>Dr. HAN?</i>

00:31:37.021 --> 00:31:37.730
Yes.

00:31:37.731 --> 00:31:42.108
<i>I got the results on the pill.
It's just a blend of plants.</i>

00:31:42.109 --> 00:31:42.943
Really?

00:31:42.944 --> 00:31:45.987
<i>It's made of mulberry
and quince leaves.</i>

00:31:45.988 --> 00:31:49.033
<i>Looks like a placebo.</i>

00:31:49.074 --> 00:31:50.575
Of course.

00:31:50.576 --> 00:31:52.328
<i>But where'd you get it?</i>

00:31:52.995 --> 00:31:56.457
It's nothing.
Thanks a lot.

00:32:07.092 --> 00:32:10.136
Call me if anything happens.
Okay?

00:32:10.137 --> 00:32:12.640
<i>- Okay. I'll call you.</i>
- Bye.

00:32:15.309 --> 00:32:16.809
Got the results?

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:19.687
Brace yourself and listen.

00:32:19.688 --> 00:32:23.066
This lighter only has
your fingerprints.

00:32:23.067 --> 00:32:23.817
Serious?

00:32:23.818 --> 00:32:25.569
Of course I am!

00:32:27.071 --> 00:32:30.156
What's the chance of
two people's fingerprints...

00:32:30.157 --> 00:32:31.741
What am I saying?

00:32:31.742 --> 00:32:32.618
The chance?

00:32:32.619 --> 00:32:37.581
About as much as farting
1,500 times at once.

00:32:39.166 --> 00:32:40.708
Watch it!

00:32:40.709 --> 00:32:42.460
- I'm sorry.
- Hurry up!

00:32:42.461 --> 00:32:43.712
I'm going!

00:32:45.172 --> 00:32:46.256
Move it!

00:32:51.095 --> 00:32:52.512
Where was it?

00:32:52.513 --> 00:32:53.930
Here.

00:32:53.931 --> 00:32:55.182
Relax.

00:33:04.775 --> 00:33:07.568
Children need batteries
replaced more often.

00:33:07.569 --> 00:33:10.322
Beware of loose wires
as they grow.

00:33:10.864 --> 00:33:14.450
Dr. HAN? Why is another doctor
doing the surgery tomorrow?

00:33:14.451 --> 00:33:18.705
He's a better expert in hearts.

00:33:18.706 --> 00:33:21.374
But why?
You're her doctor.

00:33:21.375 --> 00:33:25.044
Can't you change the dates
and do it?

00:33:25.045 --> 00:33:29.048
Don't worry.
I'll ask him to...

00:33:29.049 --> 00:33:30.676
He'll do well.

00:33:44.648 --> 00:33:46.399
<i>PLEASE VISIT</i>

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.402
Please visit?

00:33:53.032 --> 00:33:54.950
Pretty clever.

00:34:06.253 --> 00:34:07.337
Stop!

00:34:08.088 --> 00:34:09.797
Stop!

00:34:09.798 --> 00:34:10.798
Wait!

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:24.980
Fool! Get moving!

00:34:34.281 --> 00:34:37.034
<i>PLEASE VISIT</i>

00:34:41.371 --> 00:34:43.123
Damn it.

00:34:48.837 --> 00:34:50.714
Forget it.

00:35:02.726 --> 00:35:03.852
Yes!

00:35:08.857 --> 00:35:10.359
Good...

00:35:17.407 --> 00:35:19.242
Hi, SOO-A!

00:35:19.243 --> 00:35:21.870
I'm sorry. I'm on my way.

00:35:23.539 --> 00:35:25.623
Sorry I'm late again.

00:35:25.624 --> 00:35:27.792
Busy as always.

00:35:27.793 --> 00:35:32.213
Speed up, Dad.
Everyone's passing you.

00:35:32.214 --> 00:35:34.049
<i>80km per hour zone.</i>

00:35:34.091 --> 00:35:36.093
I'm going the right speed.

00:35:38.804 --> 00:35:41.598
Wanna take a trip?
It's summer break.

00:35:42.182 --> 00:35:43.058
What about work?

00:35:43.059 --> 00:35:44.600
Doctors have vacations too.

00:35:44.601 --> 00:35:46.269
Could've fooled me.

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:47.478
Why you...

00:35:47.479 --> 00:35:50.649
- Where should we go?
- Any ideas?

00:35:51.358 --> 00:35:53.152
Anywhere but the zoo.

00:35:54.403 --> 00:35:55.444
An aquarium.

00:35:55.445 --> 00:35:56.737
No way!

00:35:56.738 --> 00:35:59.740
I'm not going.

00:35:59.741 --> 00:36:01.285
An aquarium abroad?

00:36:02.661 --> 00:36:04.788
We've been to all of them.

00:36:09.459 --> 00:36:11.460
A dolphin, please.
How much?

00:36:11.461 --> 00:36:12.796
800 won.

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:14.506
Your change.

00:36:14.507 --> 00:36:17.801
- I'll take them all.
- Thank you!

00:36:24.183 --> 00:36:25.641
Yeon-a!

00:36:25.642 --> 00:36:26.935
CHOI Yeon-a!

00:36:29.396 --> 00:36:30.230
Wait there!

00:36:30.231 --> 00:36:32.316
Soo-hyun? What's that?

00:36:32.357 --> 00:36:33.734
Come on over.

00:36:37.696 --> 00:36:39.031
Soo-hyun!

00:36:40.574 --> 00:36:41.992
Are you okay?

00:36:42.492 --> 00:36:43.535
Wait!

00:36:47.539 --> 00:36:49.208
This wasn't it.

00:36:49.875 --> 00:36:51.043
What?

00:36:52.044 --> 00:36:53.712
Listen carefully.

00:37:00.427 --> 00:37:05.139
The Caspian tern gives food
to please its mate.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:10.561
Green frogs, white herons,
and zebra finches sing to please.

00:37:10.562 --> 00:37:12.897
You know I can't sing.

00:37:12.898 --> 00:37:17.027
Nothing I can say...

00:37:19.905 --> 00:37:22.783
I'm no better than
those animals.

00:37:28.747 --> 00:37:30.748
So I brought these.

00:37:30.749 --> 00:37:32.292
I swear...

00:37:34.461 --> 00:37:37.256
I won't let go of your hand
till I die.

00:37:42.469 --> 00:37:43.971
You know what?

00:37:48.433 --> 00:37:52.938
When elephants find their mates,
they go into the forest.

00:37:56.775 --> 00:37:58.776
- Hi, Mr. KIM!
- Hello.

00:37:58.777 --> 00:38:01.989
Lovely weather!
Take care!

00:38:27.264 --> 00:38:28.473
Wait.

00:38:28.515 --> 00:38:30.350
Stop! It tickles!

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:34.187
- Come on.
- It tickles.

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:39.192
You're so beautiful.

00:38:42.362 --> 00:38:44.281
Trying to tame me?

00:38:55.208 --> 00:38:56.376
Wait.

00:38:57.294 --> 00:38:59.129
Many eyes are watching.

00:39:01.381 --> 00:39:03.383
They won't attack, right?

00:39:04.134 --> 00:39:05.634
Don't worry.

00:39:05.635 --> 00:39:08.305
You're with an expert trainer.

00:39:17.689 --> 00:39:19.191
Kid! Let's eat.

00:39:21.693 --> 00:39:23.028
SOO-A!

00:39:25.906 --> 00:39:27.032
What?

00:39:28.325 --> 00:39:30.118
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

00:39:32.454 --> 00:39:34.373
<i>MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS</i>

00:39:36.958 --> 00:39:39.251
- Like it?
- Yup.

00:39:39.252 --> 00:39:42.171
I came for your stew.
That's all.

00:39:42.172 --> 00:39:43.298
Eat lots.

00:39:44.091 --> 00:39:45.884
You too.

00:39:46.551 --> 00:39:47.844
Hey, kid.

00:39:49.304 --> 00:39:51.681
How about studying in the States?

00:39:51.723 --> 00:39:54.559
No! I can't eat without Kimchi.

00:39:55.769 --> 00:39:59.438
There are great medical schools.

00:39:59.439 --> 00:40:00.523
And your mom's there.

00:40:00.524 --> 00:40:02.609
Why suddenly the States?

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.363
- SOO-A...
- Something's fishy.

00:40:07.364 --> 00:40:10.409
Got a girlfriend now?

00:40:12.702 --> 00:40:16.038
Who? Is she pretty?

00:40:16.039 --> 00:40:17.916
Not a girlfriend...

00:40:18.792 --> 00:40:23.004
But I got something nasty.

00:40:26.758 --> 00:40:28.552
The stew's delicious.

00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:32.097
Maybe a bit salty.

00:40:35.183 --> 00:40:36.601
HAN SOO-A.

00:40:37.436 --> 00:40:39.229
Thanks for dinner.

00:40:57.372 --> 00:40:58.957
HAN SOO-A!

00:40:59.624 --> 00:41:01.626
SOO-A!

00:41:02.961 --> 00:41:04.629
HAN SOO-A!

00:41:07.132 --> 00:41:08.633
SOO-A!

00:41:15.974 --> 00:41:17.517
SOO-A!

00:41:26.568 --> 00:41:28.028
Meow!

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:33.700
Meow!

00:41:39.164 --> 00:41:40.999
Aren't you cold?

00:41:46.963 --> 00:41:49.090
You're always late.

00:41:51.343 --> 00:41:52.719
I know.

00:41:53.512 --> 00:41:56.306
Uncle Tae-ho warns me
all the time.

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.188
But why...

00:42:37.722 --> 00:42:38.890
Here.

00:42:40.058 --> 00:42:42.561
Keep it. It's yours anyway.

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:47.190
I'll keep this instead.
It's mine anyway.

00:42:50.694 --> 00:42:52.403
You're me 30 years later?

00:42:52.404 --> 00:42:55.615
What's with this?

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.743
Can't wear T-shirts now.

00:43:02.664 --> 00:43:04.915
How is this possible?

00:43:04.916 --> 00:43:07.918
Let's just call it
a streak of luck.

00:43:07.919 --> 00:43:13.882
What's the world like in 2015?

00:43:13.883 --> 00:43:15.677
It's not much better.

00:43:18.388 --> 00:43:20.014
How's KIM Hyun-sik?

00:43:20.015 --> 00:43:21.391
The singer?

00:43:23.184 --> 00:43:25.604
He dies of liver cancer
5 years later.

00:43:26.104 --> 00:43:28.148
No cure for cancer even then?

00:43:29.482 --> 00:43:31.358
But technology is better.

00:43:31.359 --> 00:43:34.528
We can remove tumors
without ventrotomy.

00:43:34.529 --> 00:43:38.574
Even without cutting
the abdomen open?

00:43:38.575 --> 00:43:43.162
Still, there are new diseases
and illness.

00:43:43.163 --> 00:43:46.082
I often think the simple past
was better.

00:43:47.125 --> 00:43:51.253
Do I become a good doctor?

00:43:51.254 --> 00:43:53.297
You already are one.

00:43:53.298 --> 00:43:57.426
Insensitive to death
and knowing to keep a distance...

00:43:57.427 --> 00:43:58.927
I guess I become stronger.

00:43:58.928 --> 00:44:01.431
Your sensitivity made you
a good doctor.

00:44:02.223 --> 00:44:04.517
<i>Hello everyone!</i>

00:44:06.019 --> 00:44:08.646
- Do I have kids?
- One daughter.

00:44:08.647 --> 00:44:11.983
<i>Welcome to the Dolphin Show!</i>

00:44:14.819 --> 00:44:17.739
Yeon-a must be a good mom.

00:44:20.533 --> 00:44:24.453
Why so curious?
You'll find out as you live.

00:44:24.454 --> 00:44:30.669
<i>Koreas's first female trainer,</i>
Ms. CHOI Yeon-a!

00:44:33.672 --> 00:44:37.550
<i>Big applause, please!</i>

00:44:43.473 --> 00:44:45.225
<i>Hello!</i>

00:45:47.746 --> 00:45:49.748
<i>A big hand, please!</i>

00:45:51.875 --> 00:45:54.419
Are you sick somewhere?

00:45:55.587 --> 00:45:58.714
It's just time to go back.

00:45:58.715 --> 00:46:00.592
It's my last trip anyway.

00:46:03.678 --> 00:46:04.679
Wait!

00:46:06.639 --> 00:46:07.974
Hold on!

00:46:12.145 --> 00:46:14.355
Tell me about Yeon-a.

00:46:15.398 --> 00:46:17.065
Why'd you come?

00:46:17.066 --> 00:46:19.359
What's your real reason
for coming?

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.361
No reason.
Just came to see Yeon-a.

00:46:21.362 --> 00:46:23.156
Isn't Yeon-a there in...

00:46:25.825 --> 00:46:27.493
Yeon-a isn't there?

00:46:27.494 --> 00:46:28.953
You'll find out.

00:46:29.996 --> 00:46:31.498
Answer me.

00:46:34.626 --> 00:46:36.752
Did something happen to her?

00:46:36.753 --> 00:46:37.795
You'll know later.

00:46:37.796 --> 00:46:40.173
Know what?

00:46:42.133 --> 00:46:44.134
Don't scare me.

00:46:44.135 --> 00:46:45.428
Tell me.

00:46:55.688 --> 00:46:57.523
Go to Yeon-a.

00:46:57.524 --> 00:46:59.441
Be good to her.

00:46:59.442 --> 00:47:01.194
Tell me everything.

00:47:02.195 --> 00:47:04.364
What happens to Yeon-a?

00:47:09.911 --> 00:47:11.704
Yeon-a will die soon.

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:17.085
That's crazy.

00:47:18.837 --> 00:47:20.964
Why would Yeon-a die!

00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:24.050
She dies because of...

00:47:30.598 --> 00:47:34.602
<i>Soo-hyun? Where are you?</i>

00:47:36.062 --> 00:47:37.689
<i>Soo-hyun!</i>

00:47:44.904 --> 00:47:48.616
- What are you doing?
- Yeon-a...

00:48:18.813 --> 00:48:21.024
What am I doing?

00:48:32.452 --> 00:48:37.122
Why look at me while driving?
Look ahead.

00:48:37.123 --> 00:48:40.084
'Cuz you're pretty.
Give me your hand.

00:48:42.295 --> 00:48:45.298
If I was any prettier,
we'd be dead.

00:48:46.299 --> 00:48:48.801
- And...
- I'll keep the speed limit.

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:54.306
How's the puppy I gave you?

00:48:54.307 --> 00:48:55.432
Potato?

00:48:55.433 --> 00:48:57.559
That's his name?

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:00.688
It suits.
Can't wait to see him.

00:49:04.484 --> 00:49:05.777
Sleep.

00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:19.958
Hold on. I gotta make a call.

00:49:24.712 --> 00:49:27.756
I brought you something
to apologize for before.

00:49:27.757 --> 00:49:30.592
Tada! Food!

00:49:30.593 --> 00:49:32.345
I made it myself.

00:49:33.346 --> 00:49:34.806
I said I'm on a diet.

00:49:34.847 --> 00:49:38.183
No, Sun-young!
You're as light as a feather.

00:49:38.184 --> 00:49:39.519
Open wide!

00:49:44.983 --> 00:49:46.234
I'm sorry.

00:49:48.528 --> 00:49:51.029
You want this instead?

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:52.073
I'm good at this.

00:49:52.115 --> 00:49:54.033
- Do it right!
- Yes!

00:50:01.916 --> 00:50:03.291
- Mr. KANG Tae-ho?
- Yes.

00:50:03.292 --> 00:50:05.252
2 telegrams for you.

00:50:05.253 --> 00:50:06.878
At this hour?

00:50:06.879 --> 00:50:10.215
Said to read the top one first.

00:50:10.216 --> 00:50:13.885
Thank you very much.

00:50:13.886 --> 00:50:15.013
Goodnight.

00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:20.517
<i>Take the second telegram
and go to my house now.</i>

00:50:20.518 --> 00:50:22.520
What the hell?

00:50:26.357 --> 00:50:30.236
The criminal looks nasty...

00:50:34.282 --> 00:50:35.365
Look.

00:50:35.366 --> 00:50:37.827
If you leave now, we're through!

00:50:38.619 --> 00:50:39.746
I know...

00:50:42.081 --> 00:50:44.249
Die, you bastard!

00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:45.418
Bark! Bark!

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:52.800
Your papa is a bastard.

00:50:53.801 --> 00:50:59.974
I could be hot and heavy
with Sun-young now.

00:51:01.017 --> 00:51:02.268
You know?

00:51:03.186 --> 00:51:06.230
You dissing me?

00:51:08.983 --> 00:51:12.528
I have a bad friend
and you a bad papa.

00:51:15.782 --> 00:51:17.450
I did as you asked, pal.

00:51:19.494 --> 00:51:21.954
KIM Hyun-sik...

00:51:23.456 --> 00:51:26.416
The things I do for him...

00:51:26.417 --> 00:51:28.878
Ouch! It's working.

00:51:56.155 --> 00:51:57.281
Mom's album?

00:51:57.323 --> 00:51:58.366
<i>MOM'S ALBUM</i>

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:11.336
<i>You get me worried
and just vanish like that?</i>

00:52:11.337 --> 00:52:13.255
<i>I'm in charge now.</i>

00:52:13.256 --> 00:52:17.050
<i>If you don't come,
I'll ruin your life!</i>

00:52:17.051 --> 00:52:18.427
<i>Watch me!</i>

00:52:18.719 --> 00:52:20.178
<i>GEUM-GANG REST STOP</i>

00:52:20.179 --> 00:52:21.597
A pack of Sol, please.

00:52:21.639 --> 00:52:23.349
450 won, please.

00:52:25.184 --> 00:52:26.561
450 won.

00:52:29.522 --> 00:52:31.148
Wait.

00:52:31.149 --> 00:52:32.191
Here.

00:52:34.986 --> 00:52:37.487
Is this a joke?

00:52:37.488 --> 00:52:38.906
Sorry.

00:52:45.037 --> 00:52:48.915
I didn't come 'cuz of your threats
but to set things right.

00:52:48.916 --> 00:52:52.586
You're lying about
Yeon-a dying, right?

00:52:52.587 --> 00:52:54.547
I wish, but it's true.

00:53:06.642 --> 00:53:08.519
Why would Yeon-a die?

00:53:09.145 --> 00:53:10.521
'Cuz of you.

00:53:11.105 --> 00:53:12.064
What?

00:53:12.065 --> 00:53:15.317
You promised to hold on,
but let go.

00:53:15.318 --> 00:53:17.485
You took her for granted.

00:53:17.486 --> 00:53:20.573
Don't talk like you know me.
I'm different!

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:26.954
There was an accident
at the zoo.

00:53:33.586 --> 00:53:35.545
What accident? When?

00:53:35.546 --> 00:53:37.006
I can't say.

00:53:38.257 --> 00:53:41.844
But you know everything!

00:53:43.012 --> 00:53:44.679
You can save her!

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:45.556
I can't.

00:53:45.557 --> 00:53:47.183
Then you'll let Yeon-a die?

00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:53.730
I never forgot for 30 years.

00:53:53.731 --> 00:53:57.151
If only I could go back
and save Yeon-a...

00:53:58.402 --> 00:53:59.653
I thought a million times.

00:53:59.654 --> 00:54:00.947
Then do it.

00:54:02.114 --> 00:54:07.285
Save her.
We can stop her from dying!

00:54:07.286 --> 00:54:08.579
SOO-A.

00:54:10.414 --> 00:54:11.915
My daughter.

00:54:11.916 --> 00:54:15.710
She was born 10 years after
Yeon-a died.

00:54:15.711 --> 00:54:18.631
She was an unexpected gift.

00:54:20.258 --> 00:54:21.508
Forget it.

00:54:21.509 --> 00:54:24.261
What does she have to do with
saving Yeon-a?

00:54:24.262 --> 00:54:27.013
If Yeon-a lives,
SOO-A can't be born.

00:54:27.014 --> 00:54:28.474
Look.

00:54:32.645 --> 00:54:34.896
I can save Yeon-a
and have a child with her.

00:54:34.897 --> 00:54:37.607
She's my daughter.

00:54:37.608 --> 00:54:43.280
I raised SOO-A for 20 years.
I wouldn't trade her for anyone.

00:54:43.281 --> 00:54:46.157
And I can't live in a world
without Yeon-a.

00:54:46.158 --> 00:54:48.451
The past cannot be changed.

00:54:48.452 --> 00:54:50.663
This moment can't be changed
either.

00:54:52.999 --> 00:54:58.086
It may be the past to you,
but it's the future for me.

00:54:58.087 --> 00:55:00.840
And I decide my future!

00:55:02.049 --> 00:55:03.467
It's no use.

00:55:11.517 --> 00:55:13.352
What if I don't have SOO-A?

00:55:16.439 --> 00:55:20.066
If we don't save Yeon-a,
I won't be with anyone else.

00:55:20.067 --> 00:55:22.403
Then SOO-A can't be born.

00:55:32.330 --> 00:55:37.460
Can you give up everything
to save Yeon-a?

00:55:40.629 --> 00:55:43.257
Even my life, if I have to!

00:55:45.551 --> 00:55:47.386
Even if it's Yeon-a?

00:55:50.389 --> 00:55:52.558
Mommy's here!

00:55:54.477 --> 00:55:56.312
Potato!

00:55:59.273 --> 00:56:00.816
How've you been?

00:56:02.443 --> 00:56:04.570
You've grown so much.

00:56:08.199 --> 00:56:09.909
<i>Leave Yeon-a.</i>

00:56:10.409 --> 00:56:13.370
<i>You mean break up with her?</i>

00:56:13.371 --> 00:56:15.538
That's my first condition.

00:56:15.539 --> 00:56:17.082
But Yeon-a is my everything.

00:56:17.083 --> 00:56:19.585
It's the only way to save
Yeon-a and SOO-A.

00:56:21.212 --> 00:56:22.755
Can you do it?

00:56:28.803 --> 00:56:30.513
Forget it then.

00:56:35.935 --> 00:56:36.811
Stop!

00:56:36.812 --> 00:56:38.186
Your hands will save lives!

00:56:38.187 --> 00:56:41.440
Who cares
when I can't even save Yeon-a!

00:56:44.819 --> 00:56:46.028
You okay?

00:56:57.790 --> 00:56:59.208
Yeon-a...

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:03.337
Please save her.

00:57:04.171 --> 00:57:08.341
Second condition is
that you can't tell anyone.

00:57:08.342 --> 00:57:11.344
Tae-ho already knows.
He can be trusted.

00:57:11.345 --> 00:57:12.638
I know.

00:57:13.472 --> 00:57:17.600
But it could change Tae-ho's life.

00:57:17.601 --> 00:57:21.479
We don't know
what can change the future.

00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:23.815
It has to be just the two of us.

00:57:23.816 --> 00:57:27.319
No, just the one man who knows.

00:57:28.779 --> 00:57:29.946
Remember...

00:57:29.947 --> 00:57:32.658
You can't meet Yeon-a again.

00:57:34.702 --> 00:57:40.207
She'll be alive somewhere,
but we must live like she's gone.

00:57:46.839 --> 00:57:49.508
HAN Soo-hyun.

00:57:51.427 --> 00:57:53.761
- Soo-hyun?
- Hmm?

00:57:53.762 --> 00:57:55.473
How's SOO-A?

00:57:58.184 --> 00:58:00.727
- SOO-A?
- Yup.

00:58:00.728 --> 00:58:02.395
For our baby's name.

00:58:02.396 --> 00:58:04.981
'Soo' from Soo-hyun
and 'a' from Yeon-a.

00:58:04.982 --> 00:58:07.193
SOO-A is a pretty name.

00:58:13.949 --> 00:58:17.703
- It is.
- That's it?

00:58:18.287 --> 00:58:20.206
What if it's a boy?

00:58:25.252 --> 00:58:28.047
It'll be a girl
who resembles you.

00:58:45.523 --> 00:58:46.190
<i>BUSAN HOSPITAL</i>

00:58:46.191 --> 00:58:48.399
<i>- Packed your passport?</i>
- Yes.

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.068
<i>Should I meet you
at Seoul Station?</i>

00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:51.778
No, come to the airport.

00:58:51.779 --> 00:58:52.987
Do you miss me?

00:58:52.988 --> 00:58:55.615
<i>Of course.
It's been 2 months.</i>

00:58:55.616 --> 00:59:01.579
In 9 hours and 20 minutes,
we can be together for 3 days

00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:02.414
Yeon-a...

00:59:02.415 --> 00:59:03.748
Hmm?

00:59:03.749 --> 00:59:04.832
Be careful.

00:59:04.833 --> 00:59:07.585
Okay. See you later.

00:59:07.586 --> 00:59:08.671
Bye.

00:59:17.346 --> 00:59:18.513
Dr. HAN?

00:59:18.514 --> 00:59:20.349
Call from geriatrics.

00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:23.936
Dr. HAN speaking.

00:59:51.171 --> 00:59:53.256
Go away!

00:59:53.257 --> 00:59:57.302
Abandon me here and live it up
why don't you!

00:59:57.303 --> 01:00:01.806
You're just like your mom.
That bitch!

01:00:01.807 --> 01:00:02.890
Stop it, will you?

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:06.978
When I get my hands on her,
I'll drag her to...

01:00:06.979 --> 01:00:09.939
What did Mom do!
You tortured her for life!

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:14.945
Don't take her side!
She had an affair!

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:20.241
You're the one who cheated!
Come to your senses!

01:00:20.242 --> 01:00:24.912
She cheated on me with you!

01:00:24.913 --> 01:00:27.081
When will you stop?

01:00:27.082 --> 01:00:29.043
I've had it!

01:00:29.418 --> 01:00:34.088
I'll catch her even if I die!

01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:37.051
Bring the bitch to me now!

01:00:37.676 --> 01:00:42.055
Bring me the bitch!

01:00:42.056 --> 01:00:43.891
Ms. CHOI Yeon-a, please.

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:49.646
It's today.

01:00:49.647 --> 01:00:51.440
The day Yeon-a dies.

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:54.442
And Dad passes away too.

01:00:54.443 --> 01:00:56.862
How can I tell her about Dad?

01:00:59.114 --> 01:01:01.949
I was going to tell her later.

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:03.409
I know.

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:07.164
You pushed it off
and didn't tell her till the end.

01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:11.043
- Then the call...
- Yes.

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:13.711
I called her 30 years ago.

01:01:13.712 --> 01:01:18.049
I have to cancel the trip.
Something urgent came up.

01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:20.009
<i>You're the only doctor there?</i>

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:22.970
It's my job. I'm sorry.

01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:25.473
<i>Then take the next flight.</i>

01:01:25.474 --> 01:01:27.017
I still can't go.

01:01:27.643 --> 01:01:29.018
<i>Then I'll come to you.</i>

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:30.437
No, don't!

01:01:32.106 --> 01:01:35.733
I'll be stuck in the hospital
for 3 days.

01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:41.322
<i>But it's our vacation!
We haven't met in 2 months.</i>

01:01:41.323 --> 01:01:43.449
I have to stay with the patient.

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:46.369
What about me?
The patient's more important?

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:48.831
Don't say that.
I'm a doctor.

01:01:48.872 --> 01:01:51.374
How can you
only think of yourself?

01:01:51.375 --> 01:01:54.545
<i>I'm sorry, Yeon-a.</i>
Let's talk later.

01:02:03.804 --> 01:02:04.596
Hello?

01:02:04.597 --> 01:02:06.724
<i>Yeon-a! Something's wrong!</i>

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.405
What happened?

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:25.075
She's never been like this.
What's with her?

01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:28.620
Call for help.
I'll calm her down.

01:02:29.538 --> 01:02:33.000
Somebody help!
Anybody there?

01:02:34.585 --> 01:02:36.920
Mingky! Good girl.

01:02:37.755 --> 01:02:38.755
Mingky?

01:02:38.756 --> 01:02:40.340
Come here!

01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:44.678
Mingky! Stop!

01:02:47.389 --> 01:02:48.515
Mingky!

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:57.107
It's tomorrow's paper.

01:03:00.736 --> 01:03:03.280
<i>FEMALE TRAINER DIES SAVING DOLPHIN</i>

01:03:05.199 --> 01:03:06.991
There's no time.

01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:09.912
Now, it's your turn.

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:13.373
We must change that article.

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:17.294
Ms. CHOI Yeon-a, please.

01:03:17.836 --> 01:03:18.796
<i>Hello?</i>

01:03:18.797 --> 01:03:20.714
Yeon-a...

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:25.551
I have to cancel the trip.
Something urgent came up.

01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:27.470
<i>You're the only doctor there?</i>

01:03:27.471 --> 01:03:29.639
I'm sorry. It's my job.

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.682
<i>Then take the next flight.</i>

01:03:31.683 --> 01:03:33.351
I still can't go.

01:03:33.352 --> 01:03:35.645
<i>Then I'll come to you.</i>

01:03:35.646 --> 01:03:41.776
I'll be stuck in the hospital
for 3 days.

01:03:41.777 --> 01:03:43.986
I have to stay with the patient.

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:49.284
<i>But it's our vacation!
We haven't met in 2 months!</i>

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:53.247
Then come to me.

01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:08.178
- You came?
- Soo-hyun...

01:04:09.096 --> 01:04:11.139
Sorry to make you come.

01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:15.226
I'm so sorry.

01:04:15.227 --> 01:04:17.354
I had no idea.

01:04:25.404 --> 01:04:28.574
Let's step out.
We need to talk.

01:04:33.745 --> 01:04:37.915
Why didn't you tell me?
I would've come sooner.

01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:40.668
I would've been with him
when you're busy.

01:04:40.669 --> 01:04:43.254
Why would you see him?

01:04:43.255 --> 01:04:45.381
Because he's your dad.

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:50.888
When I was young,
he beat Mom all the time.

01:04:53.682 --> 01:04:57.602
He was a drunken wife abuser.

01:04:57.603 --> 01:05:01.063
- Now he's...
- It's okay.

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:02.900
You don't have to tell me.

01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:13.409
Mom left home when I was 14.

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:15.995
She couldn't take
the beatings anymore.

01:05:15.996 --> 01:05:18.624
Then he started
throwing punches at me.

01:05:21.668 --> 01:05:24.045
I wanted to run away too.

01:05:24.046 --> 01:05:30.218
But I couldn't leave
in case Mom came back.

She trains and sits there
to look out to the sea.

01:24:40.826 --> 01:24:43.119
Go down this way.

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.580
Thank you.

01:26:02.158 --> 01:26:06.036
I didn't realize Dad died young.
He was my age.

01:26:07.204 --> 01:26:09.331
He cursed Mom till the end.

01:26:09.999 --> 01:26:12.208
Maybe he missed her.

01:26:12.209 --> 01:26:14.545
He didn't know how to apologize.

01:26:15.796 --> 01:26:17.297
How's Yeon-a?

01:26:17.298 --> 01:26:18.549
She's fine.

01:26:19.508 --> 01:26:21.343
Everything will be fine, right?

01:26:22.303 --> 01:26:23.512
Of course.

01:26:24.138 --> 01:26:26.806
Does she have any side effects?

01:26:26.807 --> 01:26:28.267
She's alive.

01:26:29.018 --> 01:26:31.145
We saved Yeon-a.

01:26:32.396 --> 01:26:34.398
Let's be happy with that.

01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:48.370
Things will be okay.

01:26:49.705 --> 01:26:52.875
I lost Yeon-a and Tae-ho.
How can it be okay?

01:26:54.043 --> 01:26:56.086
Does it have to be
a happy ending?

01:26:57.087 --> 01:26:59.506
The story itself is important.

01:27:00.299 --> 01:27:02.509
Just live your life
to the fullest.

01:27:03.719 --> 01:27:05.596
That's not easy.

01:27:07.723 --> 01:27:10.935
This is the last time we meet.

01:27:17.733 --> 01:27:20.985
I'll miss you, HAN Soo-hyun.

01:27:20.986 --> 01:27:22.904
Young man.

01:27:22.905 --> 01:27:24.865
Now, it's your turn.

01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:55.980
Excuse me.

01:27:56.981 --> 01:27:59.275
- You dropped this.
- Thank you.

01:28:02.444 --> 01:28:06.198
<i>MAY 2nd, 1994 MET SOO-A'S
MOM AT ACADEMIC CONFERENCE</i>

01:28:08.534 --> 01:28:15.290
This is the complex case of
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

01:28:15.291 --> 01:28:18.377
<i>My third and final condition...</i>

01:28:19.003 --> 01:28:23.215
9 years from now,
you'll meet a woman at a conference.

01:28:26.218 --> 01:28:29.638
Spend some time with her.

01:28:32.641 --> 01:28:34.935
She'll be SOO-A's mother.

01:28:43.402 --> 01:28:46.989
You showed hope for children
with heart defects.

01:28:47.698 --> 01:28:49.325
You came to the conference?

01:28:50.868 --> 01:28:54.203
I'm Elaina Hong,
a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins.

01:28:54.204 --> 01:28:57.290
Nice to meet you.
I'm HAN Soo-hyun.

01:28:57.291 --> 01:29:00.544
I got curious about you.

01:29:01.295 --> 01:29:03.671
Your thesis was interesting.

01:29:03.672 --> 01:29:05.506
You must love kids.

01:29:05.507 --> 01:29:07.468
I guess I do.

01:29:09.803 --> 01:29:13.223
The sea is always so pretty.

01:29:15.142 --> 01:29:16.894
So beautiful.

01:29:17.895 --> 01:29:19.146
Me?

01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.498
Hello?

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:40.708
<i>It's Elaina.</i>

01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:42.211
<i>Remember me?</i>

01:29:43.003 --> 01:29:44.129
Yes.

01:29:45.381 --> 01:29:48.050
<i>Sorry to decide this on my own...</i>

01:29:50.886 --> 01:29:53.847
<i>We have a surprise gift in life.</i>

01:29:57.434 --> 01:30:01.730
<i>It's a girl. She resembles you.</i>

01:30:20.082 --> 01:30:21.499
SOO-A. We're home.

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:22.876
No! Potato! Stay inside.

01:30:26.255 --> 01:30:29.174
Daddy was so worried.

01:30:32.428 --> 01:30:34.972
That's my book.

01:30:51.738 --> 01:30:53.782
SOO-A! Call me.

01:31:12.509 --> 01:31:13.802
Bye, Dad.

01:31:50.172 --> 01:31:51.882
You hid it well.

01:31:53.383 --> 01:31:55.385
Damn old man.

01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:03.018
Dad?

01:32:03.602 --> 01:32:04.811
Dad?

01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:09.899
Should we go inside?

01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:10.942
No.

01:32:10.943 --> 01:32:13.028
The cool air is refreshing.

01:32:15.697 --> 01:32:17.406
SOO-A...

01:32:17.407 --> 01:32:19.867
Sorry I was a clumsy dad.

01:32:19.868 --> 01:32:21.495
Don't say that.

01:32:22.037 --> 01:32:24.289
I was the stubborn one.

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:26.375
No.

01:32:27.167 --> 01:32:30.420
I was so happy to have you
as my daughter.

01:32:31.797 --> 01:32:33.048
Me too.

01:32:35.259 --> 01:32:38.512
I was lucky to have you
as my dad.

01:32:42.933 --> 01:32:45.519
- Dad.
- Hmm?

01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:55.020
If I miss someone I can't meet,
what should I do then?

01:33:03.579 --> 01:33:06.081
Think of happy times together.

01:33:07.749 --> 01:33:11.295
The happiest moment
with that person.

01:33:13.797 --> 01:33:16.466
The memories
will make you live on.

01:33:37.362 --> 01:33:40.156
Dad? Are you crying?

01:33:40.157 --> 01:33:41.241
No.

01:33:42.492 --> 01:33:43.869
I'm not.

01:34:07.267 --> 01:34:15.267
<i>HAN SOO-HYUN (1958~2015)
REST IN PEACE DAD LOVE, SOO-A</i>

01:34:16.777 --> 01:34:18.820
<i>ORANGERINE</i>

01:34:20.030 --> 01:34:21.822
Try this, pal.

01:34:21.823 --> 01:34:23.659
I struck rich with it.

01:34:25.327 --> 01:34:31.041
After avoiding me for 30 years,
how could you...

01:34:31.875 --> 01:34:34.836
Are you Tae-ho by chance?

01:34:36.254 --> 01:34:37.338
Who's asking?

01:34:37.339 --> 01:34:39.341
I'm HAN SOO-A.

01:34:46.598 --> 01:34:48.433
He had a daughter?

01:34:49.184 --> 01:34:50.185
Yes.

01:34:50.852 --> 01:34:53.020
Dad was right.

01:34:53.021 --> 01:34:56.482
He said you'd be the last
to leave his funeral.

01:34:56.483 --> 01:34:58.777
Your dad said that?

01:34:59.319 --> 01:35:00.319
Yes.

01:35:08.578 --> 01:35:12.873
He asked to give you this.

01:35:12.874 --> 01:35:14.667
What is it?

01:35:14.668 --> 01:35:16.420
Open it.

01:35:19.589 --> 01:35:21.174
<i>TO MY DEAR FRIEND Tae-ho</i>

01:35:41.903 --> 01:35:43.488
<i>KNOW HOW MUCH I MISSED YOU?</i>

01:35:44.239 --> 01:35:47.743
<i>YOUR FRIEND IN LIFE AND DEATH,
SOO-HYUN</i>

01:36:01.923 --> 01:36:03.967
How's the Zoological Society?

01:36:04.593 --> 01:36:07.679
As usual.

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:11.766
How's the farm?

01:36:11.767 --> 01:36:12.851
Good.

01:36:17.814 --> 01:36:20.232
Is something wrong?

01:36:20.233 --> 01:36:23.152
Did Sun-young kick you out?

01:36:23.153 --> 01:36:26.406
No, she won't do that.

01:36:31.536 --> 01:36:32.996
Yeon-a...

01:36:34.623 --> 01:36:37.042
Soo-hyun passed away.

01:36:40.170 --> 01:36:42.005
He had lung cancer.

01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:58.939
I thought I was over him.

01:37:06.488 --> 01:37:11.368
Now, I guess I have to be.

01:37:18.625 --> 01:37:21.169
How could he...

01:37:24.631 --> 01:37:25.840
Yeon-a?

01:37:25.841 --> 01:37:27.300
Read this.

01:37:50.198 --> 01:37:52.033
He went 9 times.

01:37:58.456 --> 01:38:02.711
Seven, eight...
Ninth was the sea...

01:38:03.879 --> 01:38:05.547
There's one left!

01:38:13.346 --> 01:38:14.556
SOO-A!

01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:22.897
There's gotta be one left!

01:38:22.898 --> 01:38:24.149
Where is it?

01:38:28.987 --> 01:38:30.697
Where'd he leave it?

01:38:35.076 --> 01:38:36.912
His favorite song!

01:38:46.504 --> 01:38:47.756
Found it!

01:38:49.424 --> 01:38:51.259
It really exists!

01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:57.723
Hi, Yeon-a.

01:38:57.724 --> 01:39:00.143
<i>Tae-ho? What does this mean?</i>

01:39:00.185 --> 01:39:03.605
<i>- Time traveling?</i>
- That's right.

01:39:03.772 --> 01:39:05.230
<i>You expect me to believe this?</i>

01:39:05.231 --> 01:39:08.484
It's crazy, but it's true.

01:39:08.485 --> 01:39:11.612
<i>I tried to forget for 30 years.
Why are you doing this?</i>

01:39:11.613 --> 01:39:15.115
Yeon-a! I'll bring him back.

01:39:15.116 --> 01:39:16.283
<i>What?</i>

01:39:16.284 --> 01:39:17.701
I'll bring Soo-hyun back.

01:39:17.702 --> 01:39:20.120
<i>What do you mean?</i>

01:39:20.121 --> 01:39:22.290
Trust me, Yeon-a!

01:39:23.166 --> 01:39:25.126
Take the pill and sleep, huh?

01:39:32.968 --> 01:39:34.469
Gotta sleep.

01:39:47.065 --> 01:39:48.692
Why can't I sleep?

01:39:49.317 --> 01:39:50.986
Am I too anxious?

01:39:53.154 --> 01:39:54.155
What the hell!

01:40:01.371 --> 01:40:02.830
Son of a bitch!

01:40:02.831 --> 01:40:05.416
No jaywalking!

01:40:05.417 --> 01:40:07.459
I'm a cop!

01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:09.295
He just dissed me!

01:40:11.589 --> 01:40:12.881
Geeze!

01:40:12.882 --> 01:40:14.174
Who are you?

01:40:14.175 --> 01:40:15.844
Why are you here?

01:40:19.514 --> 01:40:20.890
Wow!

01:40:22.559 --> 01:40:24.018
This is for real!

01:40:24.019 --> 01:40:26.186
Real or fake!

01:40:26.187 --> 01:40:28.230
How'd you get in here?

01:40:28.231 --> 01:40:29.524
Fool!

01:40:34.446 --> 01:40:37.448
I'm sorry.
Let's go to Busan Hospital.

01:40:37.449 --> 01:40:40.118
- Why there?
- Hurry up!

01:40:43.163 --> 01:40:46.499
Know this is a police car?

01:40:47.125 --> 01:40:48.293
I know.

01:40:54.424 --> 01:40:56.884
Quit smoking! Damn it!

01:40:56.885 --> 01:40:58.052
Who are you?

01:40:58.053 --> 01:40:58.970
What?

01:40:58.971 --> 01:41:01.056
Who are you to...

01:41:01.723 --> 01:41:02.682
Tae-ho!

01:41:02.683 --> 01:41:04.558
I'm KANG Tae-ho!

01:41:04.559 --> 01:41:05.310
What?

01:41:05.311 --> 01:41:08.104
Your friend KANG Tae-ho!
Don't I look the same?

01:41:10.231 --> 01:41:11.024
KANG Tae-ho?

01:41:11.025 --> 01:41:12.233
Yes, Soo-hyun!

01:41:15.695 --> 01:41:17.030
Tae-ho!

01:41:18.531 --> 01:41:20.867
It's really you!

01:41:21.576 --> 01:41:22.827
Wait.

01:41:23.661 --> 01:41:24.828
How'd you come here?

01:41:24.829 --> 01:41:28.624
I took the last pill to come.

01:41:28.625 --> 01:41:30.667
My heart is about to burst.

01:41:30.668 --> 01:41:32.419
Then you must know everything.

01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:34.755
- Yes, I do.
- I'm sorry.

01:41:34.756 --> 01:41:37.591
Stupid fool!
Cold, stubborn fool!

01:41:37.592 --> 01:41:40.761
Why'd you break ties for 30 years
and keep it to yourself?

01:41:40.762 --> 01:41:43.598
- We don't meet for 30 years?
- That's right!

01:41:44.808 --> 01:41:47.184
I'm sorry, pal.
I had no choice.

01:41:47.185 --> 01:41:50.312
Why wait to die
to tell me everything?

01:41:50.313 --> 01:41:52.106
Die?

01:41:52.107 --> 01:41:53.565
Must be time to go.

01:41:53.566 --> 01:41:56.026
It's okay, Soo-hyun.

01:41:56.027 --> 01:41:58.946
Let's meet in 30 years.
Promise?

01:41:58.947 --> 01:42:03.910
Forget the last 30 years!
Let's meet again, pal.

01:42:05.203 --> 01:42:06.870
30 years is too long.

01:42:06.871 --> 01:42:11.416
No, 30 years fly by
like a bullet!

01:42:11.417 --> 01:42:14.461
- I'll be waiting!
- I'm sorry.

01:42:14.462 --> 01:42:16.672
Love you, pal!

01:42:16.673 --> 01:42:19.342
Let's meet again!

01:42:23.012 --> 01:42:24.722
Thanks pal.

01:42:26.766 --> 01:42:28.226
KANG Tae-ho...

01:42:49.914 --> 01:42:51.499
What happened?

01:42:54.252 --> 01:42:56.545
Stupid fool!

01:42:56.546 --> 01:42:58.630
I'm so stupid!

01:42:58.631 --> 01:43:01.342
What if it didn't work?

01:43:04.721 --> 01:43:07.724
Soo-hyun!

01:43:08.850 --> 01:43:10.559
Crazy fool!

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:12.853
I forgot to tell him
about lung cancer!

01:43:12.854 --> 01:43:15.523
How could I forget to warn him?

01:43:16.024 --> 01:43:19.527
Soo-hyun!

01:43:47.555 --> 01:43:50.557
<i>Next stop is Seoul Grand Park.</i>

01:43:50.558 --> 01:43:56.480
<i>Please get off here
for the entrance.</i>

01:43:56.481 --> 01:44:02.487
<i>Please remain seated
until the train is stopped.</i>

01:44:07.742 --> 01:44:12.247
Welcome to Seoul Grand Park,
a place of dreams and adventures!

01:44:12.288 --> 01:44:15.041
- Hello!
- Welcome to Seoul Grand Park.

01:45:46.132 --> 01:45:48.134
How long were we apart?
