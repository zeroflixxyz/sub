00:01:20.218 --> 00:01:22.634
NATHAN: You ever wonder,
like, different choices?

00:01:22.772 --> 00:01:24.291
How we might ended up?

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:25.568
SAM: No.

00:01:25.706 --> 00:01:27.363
I like the hand
we've been dealt.

00:01:38.995 --> 00:01:40.169
Sam!

00:01:59.878 --> 00:02:02.708
NATHAN: You, me, together.

00:02:02.846 --> 00:02:04.883
We were destined
for something great.

00:02:16.998 --> 00:02:18.517
MICHAEL: Why did I move here?

00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:20.174
I guess it was the weather.

00:02:21.555 --> 00:02:23.073
MICHAEL: Or the--
ah, I don't know,

00:02:23.212 --> 00:02:24.144
that thing.

00:02:24.282 --> 00:02:26.007
That magic.

00:02:28.078 --> 00:02:29.459
FRANKLIN: But I thought
we was trying to get out

00:02:29.597 --> 00:02:30.564
of this bullshit?

00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:34.671
You sounded more
and more like a snee-ah-itch

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:38.019
every day.

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:41.540
TREVOR: My job, my score,
get your own!

00:02:47.822 --> 00:02:52.241
AGENT 14: We should talk
about work.

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.691
LAMAR: We out here
gangbanging like it's '91.

00:03:00.525 --> 00:03:02.043
We all love banks!

00:03:04.908 --> 00:03:06.393
Get me a DJ.

00:03:12.364 --> 00:03:14.021
Give me a hand
with these bodies.

00:03:19.095 --> 00:03:20.752
This cannot be traced
back to me.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.619
Champagne anyone?

00:03:29.278 --> 00:03:30.658
WOMAN: Just sort of
smash things.

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:39.943
So now what?

00:04:43.248 --> 00:04:45.906
It was great to kick today off
with a look back

00:04:46.044 --> 00:04:49.496
at just some of the seminal
moments of the last 25 years.

00:04:49.634 --> 00:04:51.981
And what better way to bridge
our past and our future

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:55.605
than with a game that's graced
every PlayStation console,

00:04:55.743 --> 00:04:57.158
Grand Theft Auto.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.989
It's been a privilege
partnering with Rockstar Games

00:05:00.127 --> 00:05:01.404
for many years now.

00:05:01.542 --> 00:05:03.579
And we're thrilled
to open today with the news

00:05:03.717 --> 00:05:06.892
that that partnership will
continue with PlayStation 5.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.309
It's now just over a year
since we began sharing

00:05:09.447 --> 00:05:11.656
technical details
of PlayStation 5,

00:05:11.794 --> 00:05:14.486
but today's the day that
we've been looking forward to

00:05:14.624 --> 00:05:17.524
for years,
when we get to show you

00:05:17.662 --> 00:05:19.940
just some of the games
that demonstrate our belief

00:05:20.078 --> 00:05:23.495
that PlayStation 5 marks the
biggest generational transition

00:05:23.633 --> 00:05:25.842
our industry has yet seen.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.397
The content we've curated
for today's event

00:05:28.535 --> 00:05:31.572
showcases how PS5
has inspired developers

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.609
to create new experiences

00:05:33.747 --> 00:05:35.162
that are transformative

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.923
in how they look,
sound, and feel.

00:05:38.061 --> 00:05:39.649
Enough from me.

00:05:39.787 --> 00:05:41.582
We're gonna have the games
do our talking.

00:06:02.292 --> 00:06:04.985
PETER: A hero is just someone
who doesn't give up.

00:06:06.814 --> 00:06:08.575
Your dad said that.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.301
He was right.

00:06:13.718 --> 00:06:14.995
Now it's your turn.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:18.619
Go be a hero, Miles.

00:06:21.277 --> 00:06:22.520
MILES: Okay.

00:06:22.658 --> 00:06:23.935
Let's do this.

00:10:28.248 --> 00:10:30.250
RATCHET:

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:34.806
You all right
back there--

00:10:34.944 --> 00:10:36.428
no way.

00:10:38.568 --> 00:10:39.777
CLANK: It appears
that the dimensions

00:10:39.915 --> 00:10:41.779
are collapsing on one another.

00:10:41.917 --> 00:10:44.195
If we cannot get to--

00:10:44.333 --> 00:10:45.437
get to...

00:10:45.575 --> 00:10:47.336
Right, the ship.

00:10:47.474 --> 00:10:50.304
I mean, we can't be that far.

00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:52.375
MAN: I have it in my sight.

00:10:52.513 --> 00:10:54.308
CLANK: They have found us,
Ratchet.

00:10:59.037 --> 00:11:00.763
RATCHET: How do I steer
this thing?

00:11:00.901 --> 00:11:02.351
CLANK: Ask nicely.

00:11:02.489 --> 00:11:06.113
RATCHET: Slow down, please,
that's not listening.

00:11:11.291 --> 00:11:14.432
CLANK: The dimensions
are weakening considerably.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.123
RATCHET:

00:11:18.574 --> 00:11:20.196
How bad is it?

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.273
CLANK: Well,
it is certainly not good.

00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:29.827
RATCHET: Great.

00:11:32.105 --> 00:11:34.210
CLANK: Where are we?

00:11:34.348 --> 00:11:35.453
RATCHET: Beats me.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.116
MAN: How many arms
you got, beast?

00:11:43.254 --> 00:11:44.807
We've been boarded.

00:11:44.945 --> 00:11:46.153
Get off me ship.

00:11:46.291 --> 00:11:48.121
Foul creature.

00:11:50.606 --> 00:11:53.436
-CLANK:
-RATCHET: Clank!

00:11:59.339 --> 00:12:02.963
CLANK:  Oh, oh.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.106
Ratchet, we are too late.

00:12:09.245 --> 00:12:10.591
Ratchet?

00:12:12.455 --> 00:12:13.698
Who?

00:12:24.951 --> 00:12:27.919
Hi, I'm Marcus Smith, creative
director at Insomniac Games.

00:12:28.057 --> 00:12:30.370
The entire studio is so excited
to be able to share with you

00:12:30.508 --> 00:12:33.338
a first-ever look
at Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart.

00:12:33.476 --> 00:12:36.376
A brand new full-length
inter-dimensional adventure

00:12:36.514 --> 00:12:38.792
built from the ground up
for the PlayStation 5.

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:41.243
We're doing things we've never
been able to do before,

00:12:41.381 --> 00:12:43.486
like use dimensional rifts
to be able to leap

00:12:43.624 --> 00:12:45.385
from planet to planet
nearly instantly,

00:12:45.523 --> 00:12:48.422
or put ray trace reflections
on Clank.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.149
All of our alien worlds
are filled with density

00:12:51.287 --> 00:12:53.393
and life previously unseen.

00:12:53.531 --> 00:12:57.017
Plus Ratchet's all-new arsenal
is more exciting than ever,

00:12:57.155 --> 00:13:00.710
thanks to the DualSense's
Controller's enhanced feedback.

00:13:00.849 --> 00:13:02.920
Ratchet and Clank
are near and dear to our hearts

00:13:03.058 --> 00:13:05.474
in Insomniac and we can't wait
to share more with you

00:13:05.612 --> 00:13:08.511
in the future,
but for now here's another look.

00:13:15.311 --> 00:13:17.279
Did you see that?

00:13:20.006 --> 00:13:21.731
MAN: Like the ride, bro?

00:13:23.319 --> 00:13:25.149
Score for lombax.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.193
GIRL: It's Ratchet and Clank.

00:13:37.126 --> 00:13:39.266
CLANK: Sandsharks from above.

00:13:44.409 --> 00:13:46.170
RATCHET: Nice Sandshark.

00:13:46.308 --> 00:13:48.068
Nice Sandshark.

00:13:49.345 --> 00:13:52.935
My heroes.

00:13:53.073 --> 00:13:55.006
Was that a Kraken?

00:13:55.144 --> 00:13:57.422
CLANK: Or at least
a very large octopus.

00:14:02.634 --> 00:14:04.395
RATCHET: Robot?

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:11.643
CLANK: I will never get used
to that.

00:14:11.781 --> 00:14:13.024
RATCHET: Hey.
Break reality.

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:18.961
MAN: Don't let 'em get
to the boss.

00:14:19.099 --> 00:14:21.101
CLANK: There are various reasons
they resurfaced

00:14:21.239 --> 00:14:23.690
after all these years
but just to try

00:14:23.828 --> 00:14:26.727
and take over
the universe again.

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:28.005
RATCHET: Yeah.

00:14:28.143 --> 00:14:30.939
I kind of wish he was doing
a worse job.

00:14:31.077 --> 00:14:33.355
CLANK: He must have more plans.

00:14:33.493 --> 00:14:35.460
RATCHET: That's what
I'm afraid of.

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:54.721
MAN: Busting out a new max.

00:15:19.159 --> 00:15:20.195
RATCHET: That's all of them.

00:20:02.787 --> 00:20:05.652
Making games used to be
about these constant trade-offs

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:09.000
between the artistic vision
and technical limitations.

00:20:09.138 --> 00:20:12.176
With PS5 we're not gonna be
burdened like that,

00:20:12.314 --> 00:20:15.628
we're gonna be able to realize
artistic vision a lot better.

00:20:15.766 --> 00:20:19.356
It's got a ton of horsepower
which is very easy to unlock,

00:20:19.494 --> 00:20:22.151
and it's a machine that's really
easy to develop on.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:25.707
The PS5 will present
a paradigm shift

00:20:25.845 --> 00:20:28.192
as to what players will come
to expect from gaming.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:31.540
Will let us tell stories,
make worlds,

00:20:31.678 --> 00:20:33.232
create gameplay that I think

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:34.888
will truly captivate the player

00:20:35.026 --> 00:20:36.787
and really surprise
quite a few people.

00:20:36.925 --> 00:20:39.583
Please take a look at this new
franchise from Worldwide Studios

00:20:39.721 --> 00:20:42.758
coming exclusively
for PlayStation 5.

00:21:00.535 --> 00:21:01.881
WOMAN: Over and over

00:21:02.019 --> 00:21:05.609
I relive my first moments
on this alien planet.

00:21:11.615 --> 00:21:13.962
The crash,

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.551
the attack,

00:21:16.689 --> 00:21:18.138
my death.

00:21:20.969 --> 00:21:22.867
The crash,

00:21:23.005 --> 00:21:24.731
the attack,

00:21:24.869 --> 00:21:26.285
my death.

00:21:28.632 --> 00:21:30.875
Trapped in this endless cycle.

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:36.536
Even death is no escape.

00:21:41.852 --> 00:21:43.957
Each time I wake

00:21:44.095 --> 00:21:47.789
this planet seems
somehow different,

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:50.516
as if changing.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.761
This world
is becoming part of me,

00:21:55.935 --> 00:21:58.282
infecting my mind,

00:21:59.456 --> 00:22:01.043
my memories.

00:22:02.907 --> 00:22:05.427
The longer I spend here,

00:22:05.565 --> 00:22:08.568
the more I can feel
my sanity slip away,

00:22:10.536 --> 00:22:13.642
but I cannot lose hope.

00:22:21.926 --> 00:22:24.722
WOMAN: My only choice
is to keep fighting.

00:22:26.517 --> 00:22:28.519
To keep looking for answers.

00:22:31.902 --> 00:22:34.456
My only hope
is to break the cycle.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.358
Before the cycle...

00:22:40.359 --> 00:22:41.774
breaks me.

00:25:23.038 --> 00:25:26.490
ANNOUNCER: Welcome to London.

00:25:26.628 --> 00:25:28.285
And our main event

00:25:28.423 --> 00:25:30.321
looking to settle some scores

00:25:30.459 --> 00:25:32.945
and crush anyone in his way,

00:25:33.083 --> 00:25:36.362
Ultimo Bar Ricardo.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.985
Challenging him is Jai

00:25:39.123 --> 00:25:41.574
and the whole host
of heavy hitters.

00:25:41.712 --> 00:25:48.547
It's time for
Destruction AllStars.

00:27:18.084 --> 00:27:19.741
Hello, everyone.
My name is Josh Grier.

00:27:19.879 --> 00:27:20.984
And this is my brother, Mike.

00:27:21.122 --> 00:27:22.088
We're from Ember Lab,

00:27:22.226 --> 00:27:23.745
a small team
with a background in film

00:27:23.883 --> 00:27:25.057
and animation.

00:27:25.195 --> 00:27:26.645
And we're very excited today
to share with you

00:27:26.783 --> 00:27:28.819
the first look
at our new game.

00:27:28.957 --> 00:27:30.890
It's a story
full of adventure and charm

00:27:31.028 --> 00:27:33.893
that has themes in personal
growth and redemption.

00:27:34.031 --> 00:27:35.101
So, please enjoy.

00:27:53.844 --> 00:27:56.088
MAN: I know your kind.

00:27:58.228 --> 00:28:02.577
You sense the power
that flows through this land.

00:28:02.715 --> 00:28:06.512
Yet, you do not fully
understand it.

00:28:15.003 --> 00:28:17.247
MAN: Driven by the belief
that you can help

00:28:17.385 --> 00:28:19.283
these troubled spirits.

00:28:26.843 --> 00:28:31.537
MAN: But you cannot hide
your weakness from me.

00:28:40.166 --> 00:28:44.792
You have no power here...

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:46.621
Kena.

00:30:03.663 --> 00:30:05.527
WOMAN: You ever feel like
you're just waiting

00:30:05.665 --> 00:30:07.322
for a sign...

00:30:09.738 --> 00:30:12.120
to do that thing
you've always meant to do?

00:30:15.917 --> 00:30:18.195
Sometimes I feel like
I'm just standing on the edge

00:30:18.333 --> 00:30:20.163
of doing great things.

00:30:23.097 --> 00:30:25.720
But something's
holding me back.

00:30:27.308 --> 00:30:28.930
Maybe it's just nerves.

00:30:30.242 --> 00:30:32.623
Maybe it's the fear that...

00:30:32.761 --> 00:30:35.074
I'll never be as good
as what I imagine,

00:30:35.212 --> 00:30:37.836
when I'm still just standing
on the edge.

00:30:39.596 --> 00:30:42.185
But if we've got nothing else
to lose,

00:30:44.428 --> 00:30:45.913
might as well jump.

00:31:34.409 --> 00:31:35.652
Hi. I'm Lorne Lanning,

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:36.860
and I'm here
to share with you

00:31:36.998 --> 00:31:39.173
a game that I've been dying
to make.

00:31:39.311 --> 00:31:41.037
It's an emotionally
engaging story

00:31:41.175 --> 00:31:42.486
where rescuing is rewarding,

00:31:42.624 --> 00:31:44.833
failure is devastatingly
hilarious,

00:31:44.972 --> 00:31:47.043
and the memories
should last you a lifetime.

00:31:47.181 --> 00:31:48.492
Take a look.

00:31:58.123 --> 00:32:01.436
WOMAN: You are no longer
a slave, Abe.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.134
They believed,
trusted, followed,

00:32:09.272 --> 00:32:11.377
and it led them here.

00:32:13.655 --> 00:32:17.901
You may have escaped
the murderous blades,

00:32:19.523 --> 00:32:23.493
but the fate
of your entire people

00:32:27.359 --> 00:32:29.568
is up to you.

00:32:31.604 --> 00:32:33.675
Holy shit!

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:21.378
WOMAN: You must find
your full voice.

00:34:22.957 --> 00:34:25.511
WOMAN: You see things
others can't.

00:34:31.828 --> 00:34:34.589
Hear threats others don't.

00:34:43.253 --> 00:34:45.531
WOMAN: Fight when others won't.

00:34:52.814 --> 00:34:55.645
It's up to you to save Tokyo.

00:41:56.652 --> 00:41:58.688
AGENT 47: It was always
gonna end like this.

00:42:02.899 --> 00:42:05.523
All your hard work,

00:42:05.661 --> 00:42:07.801
all your sacrifice,

00:42:07.939 --> 00:42:09.527
only sped up the process.

00:42:29.512 --> 00:42:31.272
AGENT 47: And now,

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:33.758
you find yourself alone.

00:42:44.044 --> 00:42:45.770
AGENT 47:
Only death awaits.

00:43:04.029 --> 00:43:07.412
Hakan Abrak here
from Io-Interactive.

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:10.484
In Hitman 3,
Agent 47 is back

00:43:10.622 --> 00:43:13.591
for his most intimate
and professional contract

00:43:13.729 --> 00:43:15.972
in his entire career.

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:18.941
This is also
the dramatic conclusion

00:43:19.079 --> 00:43:21.599
for the World
of Assassination trilogy.

00:43:23.221 --> 00:43:25.741
I'm so proud to be here
to present a little glimpse

00:43:25.879 --> 00:43:27.743
of the gameplay
where Agent 47

00:43:27.881 --> 00:43:31.160
is on top of the world
in Dubai.

00:43:31.298 --> 00:43:32.402
Enjoy.

00:43:38.167 --> 00:43:41.342
MAN:  the world.

00:45:00.214 --> 00:45:02.009
Way to go. Woo-hoo.

00:47:43.101 --> 00:47:44.309
What's up, everyone?

00:47:44.447 --> 00:47:46.553
I'm Zion Williamson
of the New Orleans Pelicans.

00:47:46.691 --> 00:47:50.764
Here we go, the first ever
teaser for the NBA 2K21.

00:47:50.902 --> 00:47:52.421
Y'all are not ready
for this.

00:49:19.922 --> 00:49:21.096
Strabby.

00:49:21.234 --> 00:49:23.719
Strabby, Strabby, Strabby,
Strabby-dy-dy-dy-dy-dy,

00:49:23.857 --> 00:49:25.790
Strabby.

00:49:28.206 --> 00:49:29.656
Strabby?

00:49:29.794 --> 00:49:31.865
DOG: Amazing,
aren't they?

00:49:32.003 --> 00:49:34.109
Half bug, half snack.

00:49:36.007 --> 00:49:38.734
A very recently
discovered species

00:49:38.872 --> 00:49:41.840
entirely unique
to this island.

00:49:41.979 --> 00:49:44.395
Oh, this one's lively.

00:49:44.533 --> 00:49:46.224
Beautiful seed patterns.

00:49:46.362 --> 00:49:47.674
Strabby.

00:49:49.365 --> 00:49:51.333
Oh, and it's tasty, too.

00:49:53.128 --> 00:49:57.373
Welcome to the island
of Bugsnax.

00:50:05.519 --> 00:50:06.658
Awesome.

00:50:13.803 --> 00:50:15.460
I got it.

00:50:36.688 --> 00:50:39.105
My invitation is open.

00:50:39.243 --> 00:50:40.623
Come join me

00:50:40.761 --> 00:50:44.386
on the Island of Bugsnax.

00:50:44.524 --> 00:50:46.526
Liz, hey, um,

00:50:46.664 --> 00:50:48.045
I was trying to carry a lamp
with my weenie hands

00:50:48.183 --> 00:50:50.737
but I dropped it, and, uh,
now the town's on fire.

00:50:50.875 --> 00:50:51.841
Ugh.

00:50:51.979 --> 00:50:53.395
Again?

00:50:58.089 --> 00:50:59.953
Boing. Bunger. Bunger.
Bunger. Bunger.

00:51:00.091 --> 00:51:03.888
Bunger. Bunger. Bunger.
Bunger. Bunger.

00:51:51.246 --> 00:51:52.212
Hi, everyone.

00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:54.111
Thank you
for being with us today

00:51:54.249 --> 00:51:56.837
for this very special event.

00:51:56.975 --> 00:51:59.806
But before we get
to the end of the show,

00:51:59.944 --> 00:52:03.430
I have something
very near and dear to me.

00:53:53.368 --> 00:53:56.302
Deathloop is a next-gen,
first-person shooter

00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:59.443
about rival assassins
locked in a time loop.

00:53:59.581 --> 00:54:02.825
This is our unique vision,
what Arkane is all about.

00:54:02.963 --> 00:54:05.242
Freeform immersive gameplay,

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:09.038
a surreal, player-driven story
smashed together.

00:54:09.176 --> 00:54:10.764
Want to see
some stylish action?

00:54:10.902 --> 00:54:12.283
Check this out.

00:54:23.674 --> 00:54:25.054
JULIANNA:
Hello, Blackreef.

00:54:25.192 --> 00:54:26.435
Colt, my predecessor,

00:54:26.573 --> 00:54:28.679
has been pronounced guilty
of treason.

00:54:28.817 --> 00:54:31.682
He is to be shot on sight,
enforced in perpetuity.

00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:34.823
Your assistance is appreciated and mandatory.

00:54:34.961 --> 00:54:37.929
The real party   doesn't start until he's dead.

00:54:38.067 --> 00:54:41.519
BLACKREEF: Ahh.
She is not making this easy.

00:55:09.478 --> 00:55:10.410
BLACKREEF: It's pulled.

00:55:10.548 --> 00:55:12.757
WOMAN: Look.
We're ready to loop.

00:55:12.895 --> 00:55:15.519
WOMAN: Die already.

00:55:15.657 --> 00:55:16.865
BLACKREEF: Busted.

00:55:19.557 --> 00:55:21.283
Die.

00:55:21.421 --> 00:55:22.388
Damn.

00:55:30.119 --> 00:55:32.156
MAN: Good morning,
Blackreef.

00:55:32.294 --> 00:55:34.883
Another day,
another death.

00:55:35.021 --> 00:55:36.850
Aren't time loops fun?

00:55:40.923 --> 00:55:42.753
For everyone else
on this island,

00:55:42.891 --> 00:55:44.789
this place is paradise,

00:55:44.927 --> 00:55:46.826
a never-ending party,

00:55:46.964 --> 00:55:49.484
where hunting me
is the main attraction.

00:55:50.933 --> 00:55:54.005
And no matter
how I try to escape,

00:55:54.143 --> 00:55:56.905
they always cut me down.

00:55:57.043 --> 00:55:59.286
But I'm one stubborn
motherfucker.

00:56:14.681 --> 00:56:16.856
MAN: Every loop,
I'm learning a little more,

00:56:16.994 --> 00:56:19.099
piecing together
the puzzle.

00:56:19.237 --> 00:56:20.722
There's eight targets

00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:23.449
and they all gotta die
before midnight.

00:56:25.796 --> 00:56:28.419
MAN: There's just one
little snag.

00:56:32.285 --> 00:56:33.769
JULIANNA: You thought
it was going to be easy?

00:56:35.944 --> 00:56:37.428
MAN: Julianna Blake,

00:56:37.566 --> 00:56:41.501
Blackreef's protector
and a real pain in my ass.

00:56:41.639 --> 00:56:44.090
She may kill me
a million times,

00:56:44.228 --> 00:56:45.574
but eventually,

00:56:45.712 --> 00:56:47.058
inevitably,

00:56:47.196 --> 00:56:51.822
I will break
this fucking loop.

00:57:07.424 --> 00:57:08.528
MAN: Down you go.

00:57:33.415 --> 00:57:35.590
JULIANNA: I don't like
watching you die.

00:57:35.728 --> 00:57:37.315
I like killing you.

00:57:37.454 --> 00:57:38.696
There's a difference.

00:58:05.033 --> 00:58:07.449
WOMAN: Long ago, a young girl
went with her mother

00:58:07.587 --> 00:58:09.313
to pick berries for her father,

00:58:09.451 --> 00:58:11.764
who was hard at work.

00:58:15.871 --> 00:58:17.908
WOMAN: But the forest
greeted them with a dark,

00:58:18.046 --> 00:58:19.910
cold silence.

00:58:20.048 --> 00:58:23.361
The bushes empty.

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.294
Yet determined to find
the berries,

00:58:25.432 --> 00:58:27.469
the rascal broke free
of mother's grasp

00:58:27.607 --> 00:58:29.920
and vanished into the trees.

00:58:30.058 --> 00:58:32.267
Mother's worried cries
faded fast

00:58:32.405 --> 00:58:35.788
as the girl ran on over vine,
under branch.

00:58:37.824 --> 00:58:42.104
WOMAN: And into the forest deep.

00:58:42.242 --> 00:58:44.900
ETHAN: What is it with that
creepy story?

00:58:45.038 --> 00:58:47.627
WOMAN: It's just a local tale.

00:58:47.765 --> 00:58:51.631
ETHAN: You're really into
that stuff?

00:58:51.769 --> 00:58:54.151
WOMAN: Quit being so paranoid.

00:58:57.741 --> 00:58:59.743
-ETHAN: No, no, friendly.

00:58:59.881 --> 00:59:01.261
Friendly.

00:59:01.399 --> 00:59:02.539
MAN: Who are you?

00:59:02.677 --> 00:59:04.092
-Who sent you?
-ETHAN: What's going on? I--

00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:07.267
-Shh.

00:59:08.752 --> 00:59:11.271
-They're coming.
-ETHAN: Who is?

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.072
-ETHAN:
-MAN:

01:00:28.590 --> 01:00:30.074
ETHAN: Chris?

01:00:30.212 --> 01:00:32.870
Sorry, Ethan.

01:00:36.563 --> 01:00:37.634
ETHAN: Why?

01:02:43.035 --> 01:02:44.484
MAN:

01:02:57.774 --> 01:02:59.568
What is that?

01:03:05.436 --> 01:03:08.439
MAN: Freedom,
our freedom.

01:04:03.218 --> 01:04:06.083
ALOY: The Old Ones...

01:04:06.221 --> 01:04:08.983
perished a thousand years ago.

01:04:10.501 --> 01:04:12.400
Their great cities...

01:04:13.435 --> 01:04:15.230
turned to graves.

01:04:17.957 --> 01:04:20.235
In their place...

01:04:20.373 --> 01:04:22.203
came new life...

01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:36.596
then new dangers.

01:04:47.021 --> 01:04:49.678
ALOY: I must find a way
to stop it

01:04:51.577 --> 01:04:54.407
or it will get worse
and worse...

01:05:05.625 --> 01:05:08.283
ALOY:
...until it destroys us all.

01:05:14.358 --> 01:05:15.808
ALOY: There's nothing
I wouldn't do

01:05:15.946 --> 01:05:17.637
to save this world.

01:05:19.122 --> 01:05:21.365
No depth I won't explore.

01:05:31.375 --> 01:05:33.930
ALOY: No secret I won't unlock.

01:05:43.042 --> 01:05:45.803
No barrier I won't cross.

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.327
This mission is mine alone.

01:05:53.777 --> 01:05:55.158
If I falter,

01:05:55.296 --> 01:05:57.125
if I fail,

01:05:57.263 --> 01:05:59.300
there won't be
anyone left to stop

01:05:59.438 --> 01:06:00.991
what's coming.

01:06:35.474 --> 01:06:37.131
ALOY: But whatever comes...

01:06:44.966 --> 01:06:46.657
ALOY: I will be ready.

01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:58.393
On behalf of the entire team
at Guerrilla

01:06:58.531 --> 01:07:00.188
we're happy to share
the first look

01:07:00.326 --> 01:07:02.432
at Horizon, Forbidden West.

01:07:02.570 --> 01:07:04.158
We're continuing
Aloy's story

01:07:04.296 --> 01:07:06.298
as she moves west
to a far future America.

01:07:06.436 --> 01:07:08.645
To brave a beautiful
but dangerous frontier

01:07:08.783 --> 01:07:10.509
masked with mysterious
new threats.

01:07:10.647 --> 01:07:13.132
Get ready to explore
distant lands

01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:14.996
ravaged by massive storms.

01:07:15.134 --> 01:07:17.619
And take on new powerful
machines as you return...

01:07:17.757 --> 01:07:19.380
To the majestic world
of Horizon.

01:07:19.518 --> 01:07:21.485
Stay tuned for much more.

01:07:21.623 --> 01:07:24.488
We can't wait for you
to get your hands on it.

01:07:33.359 --> 01:07:35.396
I think there's a lot to look
forward to for the community.

01:07:35.534 --> 01:07:38.123
I think fans are gonna be
really pleased.

01:07:38.261 --> 01:07:40.090
DAN: As a game designer
and storyteller,

01:07:40.228 --> 01:07:41.885
this is incredibly exciting.

01:07:42.023 --> 01:07:43.438
We're talking
a whole new generation

01:07:43.576 --> 01:07:45.716
of ideas and experiences that
we can create for the player.

01:07:45.854 --> 01:07:49.099
No matter where they are,
no matter who they are.

01:07:49.237 --> 01:07:51.481
KYLE: New experiences
like we've never had before.

01:07:51.619 --> 01:07:53.552
More iconic,
interesting characters,

01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:55.416
more atmospheric,
immersive worlds

01:07:55.554 --> 01:07:56.831
for players to explore.

01:07:56.969 --> 01:07:58.488
AUSTIN: We want to wow players.

01:07:58.626 --> 01:07:59.730
Expect the unexpected.

01:07:59.868 --> 01:08:01.594
-And I for one can't wait.
-We can't wait.

01:08:01.732 --> 01:08:03.286
We can't wait to share them
with you.

01:08:03.424 --> 01:08:04.701
It's so exciting.

01:08:04.839 --> 01:08:05.978
Incredibly exciting.

01:08:06.116 --> 01:08:07.359
It's really about...

01:08:09.913 --> 01:08:14.124
MAN: As a developer,
it's an amazing feeling to have.

01:08:14.262 --> 01:08:16.678
Welcome to PlayStation 5.

01:11:28.214 --> 01:11:29.871
We hope you've enjoyed
the first glimpse

01:11:30.009 --> 01:11:31.597
of our future today.

01:11:31.735 --> 01:11:34.600
You've seen our most striking
