00:06:02.416 --> 00:06:04.125
{\an8}His full name is Jatil Yadav.

00:06:04.708 --> 00:06:05.833
{\an8}He is an inspector.

00:06:06.541 --> 00:06:07.958
{\an8}Look how handsome he is.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.041
{\an8}He is dark-skinned.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.166
-What?
-He is dark-skinned.

00:06:13.291 --> 00:06:14.500
But he is good-hearted.

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:17.333
Mummy!

00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.708
-What is it? Move!
-Why'd you show that girl my photo?

00:06:20.791 --> 00:06:23.708
I told you to smile a bit,
but you gave such a sullen look.

00:06:23.791 --> 00:06:25.583
See how your photo has turned out.

00:06:25.666 --> 00:06:26.750
Didn't I forbid you?

00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:29.708
It's my colleague's wedding.
My co-workers are here.

00:06:29.791 --> 00:06:33.041
I also have a wish to see you sitting
as a groom on that throne.

00:06:33.625 --> 00:06:35.166
Mr. Yadav, <i>Jai Hind!</i>

00:06:35.791 --> 00:06:37.458
<i>Jai Hind,</i> Mr. Mishra. How are you?

00:06:37.541 --> 00:06:39.750
-I'm doing good.
-Meet my mother.

00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:41.458
-Greetings, ma'am.
-Greetings.

00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:45.666
I'm Manoj Kumar Mishra.
When are you getting our boss married?

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.708
The only remaining bachelor
at our police station.

00:06:48.625 --> 00:06:50.625
-This is my wife. Say greetings.
-Greetings.

00:06:51.541 --> 00:06:53.625
And then he needs to start a family too.

00:06:54.875 --> 00:06:57.833
As soon as we find a nice girl
and he says yes,

00:06:57.916 --> 00:06:59.458
you'll have the invitation.

00:06:59.833 --> 00:07:01.083
Come, I'll drop you home.

00:07:01.166 --> 00:07:04.208
Are you leaving so soon?
The dinner hasn't been served yet!

00:07:04.708 --> 00:07:06.250
Let's go have some chaat.

00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:07.500
-Wake up, Sonu.
-Let's go.

00:07:07.583 --> 00:07:10.083
-Come, Sonu. You wanted chaat, right?
-Come, let's go.

00:07:10.166 --> 00:07:11.750
-Come on, Sonu.
-Come.

00:07:13.625 --> 00:07:19.958
<i>Here he comes</i>
<i>My beloved is finally here</i>

00:07:20.041 --> 00:07:25.708
<i>Here he comes</i>
<i>My beloved is finally here</i>

00:07:25.833 --> 00:07:32.041
<i>O my beloved, come to my doorstep</i>
<i>With a palanquin</i>

00:07:32.125 --> 00:07:38.666
<i>Here he comes</i>
<i>My beloved is finally here</i>

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:45.291
<i>My bangles ask me</i>
<i>When my sulky beloved will come</i>

00:07:45.375 --> 00:07:51.791
<i>Without him I'm not happy</i>
<i>My courtyard feels like a jail</i>

00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:57.166
Now I have to heat my meal myself.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.583
But you're always geared up
to run a fool's errand or humiliate me.

00:08:01.166 --> 00:08:02.916
You turned down the wedding meal...

00:08:04.458 --> 00:08:06.416
a cold meal is what you get
after that, son.

00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:09.541
Why were you showing that girl my photo?

00:08:10.083 --> 00:08:11.958
Didn't you see
what kind of clothes she wore?

00:08:13.458 --> 00:08:14.916
Do you think that's my type?

00:08:15.708 --> 00:08:17.208
Your head is full of crap.

00:08:17.375 --> 00:08:18.750
I want a decent girl,

00:08:19.125 --> 00:08:20.250
with a fine character,

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:23.125
who knows her limits at home and outside.

00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.125
You're so frustrated all the time.

00:08:27.666 --> 00:08:29.500
You never got any girl.

00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:31.708
So you condemn all girls.

00:08:32.583 --> 00:08:38.125
And what about the fact that you spend
hours online gaping at girls?

00:08:38.208 --> 00:08:41.250
What choice does one have
if nobody is concerned about them?

00:08:42.916 --> 00:08:46.041
And I see girls online for marriage.
You can check if you want.

00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:48.208
-Me...
-Shall I tell you the password? Check it!

00:08:48.291 --> 00:08:49.750
Why should I check?

00:08:50.333 --> 00:08:51.708
You want a beautiful fairy.

00:08:51.791 --> 00:08:55.875
Beautiful, virginal, sings a hymn
every time she opens her mouth.

00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.083
Where should I find
such an extraordinary girl?

00:08:58.166 --> 00:08:59.500
Well-behaved...

00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.333
and decent-looking.

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.666
I'm not asking for too much.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.541
Love cannot be planned, son.

00:09:08.625 --> 00:09:10.541
That's absolute rubbish.

00:09:11.291 --> 00:09:13.083
It's a life-long matter, after all.

00:09:15.875 --> 00:09:20.208
I believe that a life-partner
is someone you enjoy living with,

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.916
you get along with,
not someone the world approves of.

00:09:24.375 --> 00:09:28.208
Appearances can be deceptive,
I'm telling you.

00:09:35.458 --> 00:09:36.291
Yes, sir?

00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:39.750
I'll be there, sir.

00:09:40.083 --> 00:09:41.166
Have your meal first.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.250
-<i>Jai Hind,</i> sir.
-Have your meal first.

00:09:44.833 --> 00:09:47.000
It was the SSP's call.
He could hear everything.

00:09:47.583 --> 00:09:49.833
"Have your meal." I am!

00:10:04.708 --> 00:10:05.833
Inspector Jatil Yadav.

00:10:07.583 --> 00:10:09.541
Yes, hello. Come.

00:10:11.083 --> 00:10:11.916
What happened here?

00:10:12.666 --> 00:10:15.875
The owner of this house,
Thakur Raghubeer Singh, has passed away.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.375
I'm his brother-in-law, Ramesh Chauhan.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.000
-Was there a celebration on here?
-Yes.

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:27.875
It was Raghubeer Singh's wedding today.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.166
Raghubeer Singh's?

00:10:30.583 --> 00:10:32.208
Yes, his second marriage.

00:10:33.208 --> 00:10:35.208
My sister passed away years ago.

00:10:36.791 --> 00:10:38.708
Please come. His corpse is upstairs.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.750
Where are you going, Karan?

00:10:44.333 --> 00:10:47.333
This is Karan, Raghubeer Singh's son.
Karuna!

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.833
-Karuna!
-Yes, uncle!

00:10:49.916 --> 00:10:53.041
Please take him inside.
The inspector is here.

00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.250
Karan, come inside.

00:10:57.833 --> 00:10:59.208
What's with you?

00:10:59.916 --> 00:11:01.625
I've been telling you to eat.

00:11:01.708 --> 00:11:04.583
The ceremony was completed at 9:00 p.m.
Then there was feasting.

00:11:04.666 --> 00:11:08.041
At midnight, we found out--
Those two you just met are his children.

00:11:12.333 --> 00:11:14.083
Watch out for the broken glass.

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:17.250
Chunni!

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.208
What's all this mess?

00:11:23.166 --> 00:11:24.666
The lamp fell.

00:11:25.416 --> 00:11:27.708
Are we waiting
for an auspicious time to clean up?

00:11:28.625 --> 00:11:30.125
What if someone steps on it?

00:11:31.416 --> 00:11:33.000
I did clean up all the shards.

00:11:34.166 --> 00:11:36.750
Just do as Mummy says. Don't argue.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.166
Today, everyone is overly emotional.

00:11:41.791 --> 00:11:43.166
Yes, I can see that.

00:11:55.083 --> 00:11:57.333
They've come from the police station.

00:11:58.083 --> 00:11:59.416
Inspector Jatil Yadav.

00:12:00.458 --> 00:12:03.416
This is Vikram Singh,
Raghubeer Singh's nephew.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.125
He discovered the body.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.875
-Mr. Mishra, bring him upstairs.
-Come along.

00:12:39.916 --> 00:12:41.958
You said nothing was stolen or missing.

00:12:42.666 --> 00:12:46.208
As far as I saw, everything is intact.

00:12:46.708 --> 00:12:47.958
Except for him.

00:12:49.458 --> 00:12:50.833
What time did you get here?

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.083
At 12-- No, at 12:30.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.708
Some people wanted to go
to the temple, so they called me.

00:13:01.208 --> 00:13:05.041
-When I returned, I saw him -
-Called? So you were not here?

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:09.250
I'd gone to M.G. Road
to drop my fiancée home.

00:13:09.333 --> 00:13:10.166
At what time?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.833
At 9:30 p.m.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:17.291
-And when did you get back?
-At around 11:00-11:15 p.m.

00:13:18.083 --> 00:13:20.958
It takes only 15 to 20 minutes
to get here from M.G. Road.

00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.125
What took you so long?

00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:31.958
Actually, it's the wedding season.

00:13:32.583 --> 00:13:35.166
Wedding processions
were lined up on the street.

00:13:36.166 --> 00:13:37.916
One of them was just passing by, in fact.

00:13:42.708 --> 00:13:43.541
What time?

00:13:44.041 --> 00:13:46.250
Around 10:00-10:30 p.m..

00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:50.875
I guess... the area is quiet by 11:00 p.m.

00:13:51.875 --> 00:13:54.833
Who was the last one to see him alive?

00:13:56.708 --> 00:13:58.958
I spoke to him over the phone.

00:13:59.833 --> 00:14:01.000
Around 11:30 p.m.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.166
Is this his phone?

00:14:42.708 --> 00:14:43.958
-Mr. Mishra.
-Yes, sir.

00:14:44.541 --> 00:14:46.166
Call the station

00:14:46.541 --> 00:14:49.625
and ask for the forensic kits
that came from Delhi.

00:14:49.708 --> 00:14:53.333
I'll call, sir, but we haven't been taught
how to use them yet.

00:14:53.666 --> 00:14:55.791
-Call the ambulance!
-Okay, sir.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:58.166
-And lock the room.
-Yes, sir.

00:15:00.916 --> 00:15:03.375
Where was this stored?

00:15:03.708 --> 00:15:04.875
It is his.

00:15:05.875 --> 00:15:07.000
Come, I'll show you.

00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:15.375
As soon as I saw it,
I recognized it as Raghubeer's gun.

00:15:16.125 --> 00:15:17.708
It was stored in this cabinet.

00:15:18.583 --> 00:15:20.416
Someone broke the glass and took it.

00:15:22.333 --> 00:15:23.833
It must've been broken with this.

00:15:23.916 --> 00:15:26.583
Why are you touching it?
Put it back. Come on!

00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:33.916
So much glass was broken...

00:15:36.916 --> 00:15:38.125
a shot was fired...

00:15:41.708 --> 00:15:42.666
and yet...

00:15:44.291 --> 00:15:45.416
no one heard a thing?

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.625
Look at this area.

00:15:47.916 --> 00:15:50.291
Many guns are fired by guests
as wedding processions go by.

00:15:50.666 --> 00:15:52.125
Everyone carries a gun.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.750
How would anyone know
the source of the gunshot?

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.750
-You're his brother-in-law, right?
-Yes.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:06.291
From his first wife?

00:16:07.291 --> 00:16:11.500
Yes. And also his son's local guardian.

00:16:12.208 --> 00:16:14.333
He studies at a boarding school
in Gwalior.

00:16:15.333 --> 00:16:18.375
Raghubeer asked me to bring Karan,
so I came along.

00:16:25.291 --> 00:16:26.208
This way.

00:16:27.041 --> 00:16:27.875
Come.

00:16:30.791 --> 00:16:33.916
And, sir, this is the other route.

00:16:39.333 --> 00:16:40.833
These stairs go to the terrace?

00:16:40.916 --> 00:16:42.458
Up to the water tank.

00:16:43.833 --> 00:16:45.916
Tankers used to come to the house,
so we got them made.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
You stay here.

00:19:09.375 --> 00:19:10.208
Sir.

00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:15.000
The deceased's son-in-law, Mr. Sisodiya,
has returned and is creating a ruckus.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:18.583
-Do you all think it's a joke?
-Listen to me.

00:19:18.666 --> 00:19:20.666
Do you think it's a joke?

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:26.916
You just sit around twiddling your thumbs.
She’ll make beggars out of all of us.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.875
She'll make you all beg!

00:19:29.375 --> 00:19:31.583
-To hell with her.
-Listen to me.

00:19:31.666 --> 00:19:35.333
No one has the decency to throw
that woman to the streets!

00:19:35.416 --> 00:19:38.708
-Please.
-You all just stand by and stare!

00:19:38.791 --> 00:19:41.041
-Brother-in-law, please.
-Leave me! Get off me!

00:19:41.458 --> 00:19:43.375
Just wait and watch. To hell with her!

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Who the fuck are you? Move!

00:19:46.083 --> 00:19:48.291
Move!

00:19:48.375 --> 00:19:50.583
-Brother-in-law, what is this nuisance...
-Shoot him!

00:19:50.666 --> 00:19:52.791
I'll shoot him! How dare he touch me?

00:19:52.875 --> 00:19:54.291
Make him calm down.

00:19:54.375 --> 00:19:56.250
-Brother-in-law.
-Let me go.

00:19:56.333 --> 00:19:59.583
-Listen. Let's go inside.
-How dare you touch me? Move!

00:19:59.666 --> 00:20:01.625
Will you touch me? Go on! Try it!

00:20:02.041 --> 00:20:02.875
Go on!

00:20:03.458 --> 00:20:04.958
Get one thing straight, okay?

00:20:05.416 --> 00:20:07.916
I'm next in line after your father.

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:09.166
Only me!

00:20:12.583 --> 00:20:14.250
Brother-in-law...

00:20:19.666 --> 00:20:20.500
Mummy.

00:20:30.291 --> 00:20:31.791
Let me make one thing crystal clear.

00:20:31.875 --> 00:20:34.333
I'm going to investigate this murder.

00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:37.958
Whom to arrest and whom to throw out,
I decide.

00:20:39.458 --> 00:20:42.500
So no one goes out
without my permission, got it?

00:20:43.625 --> 00:20:44.625
No one!

00:20:48.875 --> 00:20:51.791
-Mr. Mishra, get everyone's details.
-Yes, sir.

00:20:57.375 --> 00:20:58.250
May I come in?

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.125
Chunni, I won't meet anyone now.

00:21:08.083 --> 00:21:09.291
You'll have to meet me.

00:21:10.708 --> 00:21:12.291
Either here or at the police station.

00:21:13.083 --> 00:21:15.583
Fine. Get a lady constable,
and I'll come with you.

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:19.291
Constable Kamla Kumari’s disposition
is tougher than the sight of my face.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.333
I'd deal with me if I were you.

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.208
Where are you from?

00:21:29.666 --> 00:21:32.333
I didn't see any of your family
on this joyous occasion.

00:21:33.708 --> 00:21:34.791
She has no family.

00:21:35.541 --> 00:21:36.750
She lives here alone.

00:21:38.291 --> 00:21:40.541
She is an orphan
so she doesn't have a family.

00:21:40.916 --> 00:21:43.208
"We found her in the trash,"
is all there's left to say.

00:21:44.416 --> 00:21:47.125
She must've come from somewhere.
It's not like she fell from the sky.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.500
Where were you before the wedding?

00:21:55.583 --> 00:21:56.416
Right here...

00:21:57.958 --> 00:21:59.041
with Raghubeer Singh.

00:22:00.958 --> 00:22:03.083
Chunni, get me a glass of water.

00:22:03.166 --> 00:22:04.833
-Chunni, stay here.
-Leave!

00:22:15.791 --> 00:22:16.958
Go ahead.

00:22:19.041 --> 00:22:20.583
So you were his mistress.

00:22:22.375 --> 00:22:24.125
And now you’re the missus.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.916
That explains all the ruckus in the house.

00:22:29.041 --> 00:22:30.666
I won't be able to help you.

00:22:32.375 --> 00:22:34.041
I was downstairs the whole time.

00:22:34.833 --> 00:22:37.166
Someone rearranged his face.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.958
You won't even recognize him.

00:22:42.041 --> 00:22:44.958
-I said I was downstairs. I saw nothing.
-Lower your voice!

00:22:46.416 --> 00:22:48.875
Or I'll drag you to the station
right now, got it?

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:58.333
Why are you evesdropping?

00:22:59.458 --> 00:23:01.875
I just came to check on you, aunty.

00:23:02.583 --> 00:23:03.458
Are you okay?

00:23:03.541 --> 00:23:06.708
Call me aunty again,
and I will slap you. Got it?

00:23:08.375 --> 00:23:09.208
Okay.

00:23:15.875 --> 00:23:16.916
I shall leave as well.

00:23:17.583 --> 00:23:20.333
Remember the name, Inspector Jatil Yadav.
We’ll meet again.

00:23:33.791 --> 00:23:35.000
Sign here.

00:23:36.333 --> 00:23:38.083
Write your name and address here.

00:23:40.791 --> 00:23:42.250
-Do you live in Gwalior?
-Yes.

00:23:59.083 --> 00:24:00.333
Come along, Mr. Mishra.

00:24:20.333 --> 00:24:23.291
2/5 LAXMI SQUARE, BAMOR, MORENA DISTRICT -
REBEL OF CHAMBAL VALLEY

00:24:23.375 --> 00:24:24.750
Rebel of Chambal Valley.

00:24:57.333 --> 00:24:58.291
My daughter...

00:24:59.583 --> 00:25:00.708
jumped off?

00:25:01.583 --> 00:25:03.250
This is what she was wearing.

00:25:04.291 --> 00:25:05.750
The girl ran away?

00:25:06.333 --> 00:25:08.166
Is she dead?

00:25:22.958 --> 00:25:24.416
Leave me!

00:25:25.166 --> 00:25:27.166
Who are you? Leave me!

00:25:32.958 --> 00:25:34.833
She has made my life hell.

00:25:35.666 --> 00:25:38.791
She tries to jump out at every station.

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.541
Now you can go to sleep. I'm here.

00:25:47.583 --> 00:25:48.666
I'll keep an eye.

00:25:51.083 --> 00:25:52.208
I'm a police officer.

00:25:52.583 --> 00:25:53.916
Sub-inspector Jatil Yadav.

00:26:20.041 --> 00:26:21.250
Where are you from?

00:26:25.625 --> 00:26:26.791
What's your name?

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.833
Radha. Bamor. Morena district.

00:26:34.458 --> 00:26:35.666
So you're from Chambal.

00:26:37.416 --> 00:26:38.250
So, you're a rebel.

00:26:43.541 --> 00:26:45.416
I’m a cop, so take it from me.

00:26:48.458 --> 00:26:50.125
It’s a cruel world out there.

00:27:01.458 --> 00:27:02.333
JATIL YADAV

00:27:02.416 --> 00:27:04.208
What can I say, dear?

00:27:04.291 --> 00:27:06.250
He’s not exactly getting any younger.

00:27:06.333 --> 00:27:08.125
And no girl is accepting the proposal.

00:27:08.708 --> 00:27:11.375
I’m telling you, at this point
I’ll be okay with any girl at all.

00:27:14.958 --> 00:27:17.666
Yes, I showed his picture at the wedding.

00:27:18.375 --> 00:27:20.500
and she said that he is dark-skinned.

00:27:21.583 --> 00:27:23.833
Ajay Devgan is equally dark.

00:27:24.625 --> 00:27:26.625
Doesn’t make him any less of a hero.

00:27:28.291 --> 00:27:32.375
When Jatil steps out in uniform
with his shades on,

00:27:32.916 --> 00:27:34.916
he looks just like Ajay Devgan.

00:27:36.875 --> 00:27:40.208
I’m just on the hunt for a girl
who can see that.

00:28:04.041 --> 00:28:05.041
This...

00:28:05.958 --> 00:28:08.458
Raghubeer Singh's wife,
when did she  pass away?

00:28:09.083 --> 00:28:10.750
About five years ago.

00:28:12.125 --> 00:28:14.708
She was returning from Gwalior by road.

00:28:15.458 --> 00:28:17.416
She and the driver were killed
in a robbery.

00:28:18.708 --> 00:28:22.083
Then Raghubeer Singh brought this girl,
from God-knows-where.

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.500
Did she tell you anything about herself?

00:28:30.708 --> 00:28:31.583
The MLA?

00:28:32.333 --> 00:28:33.166
Munna Raja.

00:28:34.375 --> 00:28:36.708
Raghubeer helped him win many elections.

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:40.250
But this time, Raghubeer Singh
was planning to run himself.

00:28:41.333 --> 00:28:42.166
I know.

00:28:44.041 --> 00:28:45.541
That's why he married that girl.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.875
Did you meet Munna Raja?

00:28:48.166 --> 00:28:51.333
I heard he took the Prayagraj Express
to Delhi the same night.

00:28:52.875 --> 00:28:53.875
He'll be back today.

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:59.416
Vikram Singh, Raghubeer Singh's nephew.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:03.916
And that's probably his fiancée.

00:29:04.541 --> 00:29:06.000
-This one, right?
-Yes.

00:29:06.416 --> 00:29:07.375
Nice girl.

00:29:09.875 --> 00:29:12.291
Vasudha Singh, Vikram Singh's sister.

00:29:12.916 --> 00:29:14.500
And that's their mother, Pramila Singh.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.083
I've heard she has moved out.

00:29:17.708 --> 00:29:20.041
Hold on!
This is Raghubeer Singh's son, right?

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:24.583
Yes, that’s him. He got caught with drugs.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.625
Raghubeer himself came to the station
to bail him out.

00:29:28.208 --> 00:29:29.083
That's how I know him.

00:29:30.625 --> 00:29:31.666
Ravi Sisodiya.

00:29:32.458 --> 00:29:33.875
The prodigal son-in-law.

00:29:35.416 --> 00:29:38.500
The Thakur dies
and leaves behind a wealthy widow.

00:29:39.583 --> 00:29:41.166
And leaves him hanging for scraps.

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:44.208
-Now he's trying to put the girl in jail.
-Which one?

00:29:45.125 --> 00:29:46.750
Raghubeer Singh's whore?

00:29:47.875 --> 00:29:50.833
Well, that's it.
She must have got it done. 100 percent.

00:29:51.416 --> 00:29:55.500
Why... why are you... all fired-up?

00:29:57.125 --> 00:29:58.791
Why are you losing your temper?

00:29:59.416 --> 00:30:01.000
Conduct an investigation first.

00:30:01.958 --> 00:30:03.875
-That's what is going on.
-Then move on.

00:30:05.625 --> 00:30:06.458
Get going.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Okay, fine.

00:32:18.625 --> 00:32:20.125
I'll kill you! I swear!

00:32:20.208 --> 00:32:23.750
-Shoot me! You fucking coward! Shoot!
-Nandu, get the gun.

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:27.125
Take aim at me! Come on! Coward!

00:32:27.208 --> 00:32:30.125
-Put your gun up! Come on!
-Hold him. You simmer down!

00:32:30.208 --> 00:32:33.083
Shoot! Shoot me!

00:32:33.166 --> 00:32:37.125
I'll kill everyone!
Don't look at me like that!

00:32:39.083 --> 00:32:40.916
May you rot in hell!

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.291
Fuck off! Fucking bitch!

00:32:43.375 --> 00:32:46.541
Shut up or I’ll blow your brains out
right here.

00:32:50.416 --> 00:32:51.958
How dare you hit the son of the house?

00:32:52.041 --> 00:32:55.000
The kid shoots a defenceless animal
and I do nothing?

00:32:55.333 --> 00:32:56.875
I’ll lock you all up.

00:32:56.958 --> 00:32:58.416
Only if you survive, right?

00:32:59.208 --> 00:33:01.083
I’m calling Munna Raja.
Enough of your shit.

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.541
-Calm down.
-How dare he touch him?

00:33:03.625 --> 00:33:05.916
Call whoever you want to. Go ahead.

00:33:06.416 --> 00:33:07.625
-Just wait.
-Call him.

00:33:08.625 --> 00:33:12.708
With my brother-in-law gone,
there’s no man left in the house.

00:33:15.375 --> 00:33:18.625
Hello. It's Ravi Sisodiya speaking.

00:33:18.708 --> 00:33:21.416
The policemen are bullying us here
since this morning.

00:33:22.291 --> 00:33:24.541
Yes. They slapped Karan as well.

00:33:24.625 --> 00:33:27.041
-Yes...
-Doesn't she feel suffocated in there?

00:33:29.166 --> 00:33:31.291
Quiet. Let's go in.

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:44.708
If you permit, may I enter?

00:33:56.125 --> 00:33:58.291
So, you remembered me?

00:34:00.208 --> 00:34:01.333
How many years has it been?

00:34:04.333 --> 00:34:05.916
A hundred, a thousand...
what’s the difference?

00:34:10.666 --> 00:34:11.875
How did you end up here?

00:34:13.291 --> 00:34:14.958
Mother died. Father sold me.

00:34:16.958 --> 00:34:18.500
Ever been to a police station?

00:34:21.333 --> 00:34:24.208
Cops line up at this doorstep
and I go to the station?

00:34:24.916 --> 00:34:26.708
You weren't imprisoned,
could have run away.

00:34:28.875 --> 00:34:30.166
I did once.

00:34:31.541 --> 00:34:32.916
But I couldn't get too far.

00:34:35.166 --> 00:34:36.375
Where could I go anyway?

00:34:38.208 --> 00:34:39.500
It’s a cruel world out there.

00:34:40.416 --> 00:34:42.541
You’re a cop, you should know.

00:34:54.458 --> 00:34:56.208
As a cop, let me tell you...

00:34:58.375 --> 00:35:01.375
if you've done something,
now is the time to spill your guts.

00:35:03.666 --> 00:35:05.916
If you killed him
or had him killed...

00:35:06.791 --> 00:35:07.958
you won't escape.

00:35:09.333 --> 00:35:13.166
I'm not insane to kill him
and make my life even worse.

00:35:16.208 --> 00:35:19.000
That's why I'm saying,
tell me the truth, trust me--

00:35:19.083 --> 00:35:20.666
I didn't even trust my father.

00:35:23.125 --> 00:35:25.500
It's crucial to know your place here.

00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:30.000
Neither will you be able to help me,
nor do I have any expectation.

00:35:30.666 --> 00:35:31.958
Don't talk rubbish.

00:35:32.041 --> 00:35:33.791
If you suspect anyone, then say it.

00:35:34.375 --> 00:35:35.500
I suspect everyone.

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:41.458
He didn't really care for anyone.
And no one really cared for him.

00:35:45.458 --> 00:35:46.958
He left you with everything.

00:35:49.916 --> 00:35:51.958
Must have cared for you a little.

00:35:52.916 --> 00:35:54.375
You were with him…

00:35:56.791 --> 00:35:57.750
day in, day out.

00:35:59.625 --> 00:36:02.333
His affection was for lifeless things.

00:36:04.583 --> 00:36:06.458
I still have a lot of life in me.

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:34.208
I thought that I helped you that night.

00:36:36.375 --> 00:36:38.041
But now it seems I was wrong.

00:36:43.166 --> 00:36:45.291
I won't let you
suffer the same fate again.

00:36:46.916 --> 00:36:50.291
But I won’t tolerate any deceit,
remember that.

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:43.208
Looks like you’ve made yourself at home.

00:37:47.083 --> 00:37:49.416
Uncle, please connect me
to a senior officer.

00:37:50.166 --> 00:37:52.416
This station-in-charge is useless.

00:37:56.041 --> 00:37:57.166
Look...

00:38:01.041 --> 00:38:02.458
The Thakur has passed away...

00:38:04.458 --> 00:38:06.208
leaving his whore behind.

00:38:08.583 --> 00:38:10.666
This family's prestige is crumbling.

00:38:12.875 --> 00:38:13.916
Do you understand?

00:38:15.208 --> 00:38:17.041
For those who traffic girls...

00:38:18.375 --> 00:38:20.291
fussing about prestige is pointless.

00:38:22.583 --> 00:38:25.916
As for complaining to my senior officer,
listen up, Mr. Sisodiya...

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:28.458
I'm not afraid of anyone.

00:38:28.916 --> 00:38:31.958
And if you try to hamstring me,
then come what may,

00:38:32.041 --> 00:38:35.250
I will dig out the truth.

00:38:36.291 --> 00:38:38.833
I'll take your leave. Greetings.
Nandu, take his statement.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.708
Did you see that?
Do you see the arrogance?

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:49.750
Greetings.

00:38:51.958 --> 00:38:54.958
I just need your statement.

00:38:55.458 --> 00:38:59.375
Where were you yesterday night?
I mean, on the wedding night, sir?

00:39:11.208 --> 00:39:13.166
Mr. Mishra, did you talk to that woman?

00:39:13.458 --> 00:39:15.041
Sir, that woman is mad.

00:39:15.958 --> 00:39:19.291
You just don’t want to work, do you?
I told you to enquire.

00:39:19.958 --> 00:39:20.791
She's a mute, sir.

00:39:21.625 --> 00:39:23.750
-Is she a mute or mad?
-She is both, sir.

00:39:24.083 --> 00:39:28.375
Sir, she was the maid here.
Her granddaughter works here now.

00:39:28.875 --> 00:39:33.041
I went to enquire once. Crazy, old bat
chased me away with a sickle.

00:39:33.125 --> 00:39:34.666
It was her son… the driver

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:37.250
who was returning from Gwalior
with Raghubeer’s wife.

00:39:48.041 --> 00:39:49.625
Approximate time of death...

00:39:50.458 --> 00:39:52.208
is between 10:00 p.m. and midnight.

00:39:52.833 --> 00:39:54.791
And the body was discovered by 12:30 a.m..

00:39:55.666 --> 00:39:57.208
-Right?
-Yes.

00:39:57.416 --> 00:39:59.916
About an hour before that...

00:40:01.166 --> 00:40:02.750
Vikram had spoken to him...

00:40:04.291 --> 00:40:05.125
on the phone.

00:40:06.875 --> 00:40:09.166
That means he was murdered
during that period.

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.791
Yes. First, he was shot.

00:40:12.583 --> 00:40:17.375
Then he was bludgeoned repeatedly
on the head, with the same gun.

00:40:19.875 --> 00:40:21.375
When the house was quiet....

00:40:22.333 --> 00:40:23.666
only family members...

00:40:25.541 --> 00:40:27.041
but no one heard a thing.

00:40:30.708 --> 00:40:33.833
It seems someone was very upset
with this man.

00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:44.958
What do you think?

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.750
Think? It's obvious.

00:40:47.458 --> 00:40:48.875
It’s an inside job.

00:40:49.333 --> 00:40:51.041
Gobi manchurian, chicken chilly, lollipop?

00:40:51.291 --> 00:40:52.875
Bring some chowmein for us.

00:40:53.458 --> 00:40:55.458
I won't have noodles. Fried rice for me.

00:40:56.083 --> 00:40:58.541
-What's with you? Try something new.
-Fried rice.

00:40:59.166 --> 00:41:00.583
What's wrong with chowmein?

00:41:01.708 --> 00:41:04.750
Eating chowmein makes you look like
an animal. Look at him.

00:41:10.583 --> 00:41:12.333
Take a chance in life for once.

00:41:12.958 --> 00:41:13.833
Just look at me.

00:41:14.625 --> 00:41:17.416
You know, I met Pinki just once.

00:41:17.791 --> 00:41:20.666
So simple, so shy, that she didn't even
let me touch her last night.

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:22.416
Nandu, listen to me...

00:41:23.708 --> 00:41:25.083
This case is twisted.

00:41:26.208 --> 00:41:27.041
Pay attention.

00:41:30.041 --> 00:41:33.041
The house was quiet by 11:00 p.m.

00:41:33.666 --> 00:41:36.625
All the guests were gone.
It's not like it was a grand function.

00:41:37.125 --> 00:41:40.458
No music, no crowd, no processions.

00:41:40.958 --> 00:41:43.208
During that time,
the cabinet was broken...

00:41:44.791 --> 00:41:47.208
a shot was fired and no one heard a thing.

00:41:48.958 --> 00:41:50.833
Then, he must've been killed before that.

00:41:50.916 --> 00:41:53.583
When wedding processions were passing by,
between 10 and 11:00 p.m.

00:41:53.666 --> 00:41:54.541
Exactly.

00:41:55.541 --> 00:41:57.791
That's the only possible time
for the murder.

00:41:59.041 --> 00:42:01.666
And that hero says... what's-his-name?

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:03.166
-Vikram.
-Yes, Vikram Singh.

00:42:04.083 --> 00:42:07.000
Says he was on the phone
with Raghubeer Singh at 11:30 p.m.

00:42:08.166 --> 00:42:09.958
It makes no sense.

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:15.666
Vikram Singh is Raghubeer Singh's nephew.
Maybe he's twisting things.

00:42:16.541 --> 00:42:18.291
Get the details of that phone call.

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:20.416
And find exact--

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:25.583
You eat it.

00:42:44.166 --> 00:42:46.416
Here, Jatil Yadav, Lord Shiva's offering.

00:42:47.083 --> 00:42:47.916
So...

00:42:49.166 --> 00:42:51.416
where has the investigation reached?
What now?

00:42:51.958 --> 00:42:53.000
You tell me, sir.

00:42:54.333 --> 00:42:56.583
MLA Munna Raja called this morning.

00:42:57.833 --> 00:42:59.458
You were very rude to him.

00:43:00.541 --> 00:43:01.500
He was infuriated.

00:43:02.416 --> 00:43:03.250
Look...

00:43:04.041 --> 00:43:06.666
Munna Raja may be an independent MLA,

00:43:07.083 --> 00:43:08.666
but every party sides with him.

00:43:10.166 --> 00:43:11.125
Got it?

00:43:11.416 --> 00:43:13.166
So next time, keep your cool.

00:43:13.916 --> 00:43:15.583
I've persuaded him for now,

00:43:15.666 --> 00:43:18.666
saying,
"Jatil Yadav is a very good officer.

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:20.791
He's sincere, hard working."

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:23.916
-Thank you, sir.
-Yes.

00:43:24.333 --> 00:43:26.416
Since he also wants this case solved...

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:28.458
he's remaining calm.

00:43:29.416 --> 00:43:32.166
But next time, Jatil, be careful.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:43.916
Mummy!

00:43:46.083 --> 00:43:47.000
Mummy!

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:58.875
Mummy!

00:44:00.333 --> 00:44:02.416
-Mummy!
-Coming! What happened?

00:44:18.041 --> 00:44:18.958
What is this?

00:44:20.041 --> 00:44:21.500
Don't you know what it is?

00:44:23.333 --> 00:44:26.916
I'm telling you,
stop messing with my things. Okay?

00:44:27.666 --> 00:44:28.958
Just watch your TV shows.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.875
How’s your case going? Caught anyone yet?

00:44:32.958 --> 00:44:34.416
How? It’s only been one day.

00:44:35.541 --> 00:44:38.166
I was asking because if you are free,

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:40.833
we can go to see a girl this Sunday.

00:44:40.916 --> 00:44:41.875
I don't want to.

00:44:42.458 --> 00:44:44.791
Why? Have you found someone?

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:48.500
Because of you I won’t go.
You’ll pull out a dowry list again.

00:44:48.916 --> 00:44:51.875
We lost many proposals
because I didn't make any demands.

00:44:51.958 --> 00:44:55.458
"Your son must have a flaw, Sarita ma'am.
That's why you've no demands."

00:44:55.541 --> 00:44:57.083
That flaw is thanks to you.

00:44:57.166 --> 00:45:00.041
You wrote Jatil instead of Jatin.
On my high school certificate, no less.

00:45:00.416 --> 00:45:02.458
I told you to get it changed back.

00:45:02.875 --> 00:45:04.458
You sound like a broken record.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:06.375
Look--

00:45:07.333 --> 00:45:08.791
Just watch your favorite series.

00:45:10.083 --> 00:45:12.875
The water pipe’s been broken for days,
and no one bats an eye.

00:45:12.958 --> 00:45:15.916
Had the cable been cut,
there'd be revolution in the streets.

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:18.541
Why are you in a bad mood
all the time, son?

00:45:19.125 --> 00:45:21.000
You carry chaos home with you.

00:45:21.083 --> 00:45:23.708
So what should I do? Should I leave?

00:45:23.833 --> 00:45:25.000
When did I say that?

00:45:25.416 --> 00:45:27.541
You just can't speak nicely to me,
can you?

00:45:29.666 --> 00:45:31.083
I remember your father…

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:36.250
He always spoke to me
with sugar-coated words.

00:45:36.583 --> 00:45:37.750
He was a cook.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.291
Sugar-coating was his job.

00:45:40.458 --> 00:45:43.083
He was a cook at the officers' mess,
not at a soup kitchen!

00:45:43.916 --> 00:45:47.791
The halwa he used to make
was finger-licking good.

00:45:48.333 --> 00:45:51.208
-The officers'd say, "Subedar Yadav--"
-"Subedar Yadav,

00:45:51.291 --> 00:45:54.416
Give the enemy a taste of your Halwa,
and they’ll drop their weapons."

00:45:55.375 --> 00:45:58.375
Exactly.
Everyday, he would tell the same tale.

00:45:59.083 --> 00:46:02.750
But at least he would talk to me
and not be cranky all the time.

00:46:05.833 --> 00:46:07.458
I miss him.

00:46:11.125 --> 00:46:12.750
Should I talk to the walls now?

00:46:14.458 --> 00:46:16.083
I miss him so much.

00:46:17.333 --> 00:46:20.083
-Mummy...
-To hell with Mummy!

00:46:27.583 --> 00:46:28.416
Yes, Nandu?

00:46:28.833 --> 00:46:32.833
I found out, boss. There was a call
made from Raghubeer Singh’s phone.

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:34.333
At 11:30 p.m.?

00:46:35.125 --> 00:46:37.791
-Yes, but there's something else.
-What?

00:46:37.875 --> 00:46:39.625
Before that phone call,

00:46:39.708 --> 00:46:43.083
<i>Vikram Singh received many phone calls</i>
<i>from another phone number.</i>

00:46:43.583 --> 00:46:45.291
Ten times a day and 12 at night.

00:46:45.666 --> 00:46:46.500
Whose number is it?

00:46:47.541 --> 00:46:50.333
Raghubeer Singh’s. A second number.

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:52.416
Send the number to me.

00:46:55.083 --> 00:46:57.458
Listen,
head straight to the police station.

00:47:16.291 --> 00:47:17.125
<i>Hello.</i>

00:47:20.166 --> 00:47:21.000
<i>Yes?</i>

00:47:41.208 --> 00:47:43.416
That was a tragic tale
you told me the other day.

00:47:45.083 --> 00:47:47.666
How long have you been hooking up
with Vikram Singh?

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:49.750
Or did he also force himself upon you?

00:47:54.416 --> 00:47:55.625
He didn't.

00:47:57.250 --> 00:47:59.083
I went to him willingly.

00:48:00.125 --> 00:48:01.375
I used to love him.

00:48:04.125 --> 00:48:07.333
But... this eternal love
is coming to an end.

00:48:09.166 --> 00:48:12.250
He is getting married to a girl
of his status.

00:48:17.666 --> 00:48:22.583
It takes guts to love me, not status...
which he doesn't have.

00:48:26.125 --> 00:48:28.583
I've checked
your and Vikram Singh's call records.

00:48:30.625 --> 00:48:32.958
You two may have ganged up
to kill the Thakur

00:48:34.041 --> 00:48:36.291
but only you will go to jail, not Vikram.

00:48:36.375 --> 00:48:38.666
That's why
I want an impartial investigation.

00:48:39.333 --> 00:48:41.291
-and ensure that you get justice.
-Look, sir...

00:48:41.375 --> 00:48:43.416
I didn't come to you asking for justice.

00:48:44.875 --> 00:48:49.125
As for the impartial investigation,
that's your duty... not a favor to me.

00:48:50.291 --> 00:48:54.166
So stop following me
and showing sympathy in private.

00:48:59.166 --> 00:49:01.833
I wouldn't let someone like you
anywhere near me.

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:06.750
I came to help you, out of pity.

00:49:08.125 --> 00:49:12.916
Such loathing... such doubt.
How could you possible help me?

00:49:13.458 --> 00:49:16.833
You think you deserve better?

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:22.333
Someone who sleeps with two men
under the same roof.

00:49:28.625 --> 00:49:31.458
I’d rather suffer open deceit
than take your help.

00:49:38.625 --> 00:49:41.583
You reveal your scars,
and hide behind your words.

00:49:43.875 --> 00:49:45.250
I can't figure you out.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:54.875
Go inside.

00:49:57.041 --> 00:49:57.916
Why should I?

00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:01.458
I told him everything already.

00:50:02.958 --> 00:50:03.916
Go on, take action.

00:50:04.625 --> 00:50:05.958
I told you everything.

00:50:06.625 --> 00:50:08.750
Now do your impartial investigation.

00:50:24.875 --> 00:50:25.916
Hurry up.

00:50:30.125 --> 00:50:30.958
Come on.

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:32.333
Mummy.

00:50:33.333 --> 00:50:35.333
-Take him in.
-Where are you taking my brother?

00:50:35.416 --> 00:50:37.166
Where are you taking my brother?

00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:40.583
-Where are you taking my son?
-Stop. Is this how you investigate?

00:50:40.666 --> 00:50:44.291
Vikram, stop.
They can't just take you away like this.

00:50:45.708 --> 00:50:47.666
-Where are you taking him?
-Where?

00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:50.208
-Shut up and go back in.
-Just go inside, you two!

00:50:50.333 --> 00:50:52.875
-Come on, get in.
-Stop, Vikram.

00:50:52.958 --> 00:50:54.041
I'll be right back.

00:50:57.375 --> 00:50:59.666
Vikram, get out of the Jeep. Vikram!

00:51:11.083 --> 00:51:13.083
Your beloved uncle’s new bride

00:51:13.791 --> 00:51:16.291
kept calling you all day
over and over again

00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:18.791
while you were in the same house.

00:51:18.875 --> 00:51:19.958
She is delusional.

00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:24.000
She thought I would elope with her.

00:51:24.083 --> 00:51:26.166
You had no problem
getting her in the sack, though.

00:51:26.875 --> 00:51:28.166
She came to me herself.

00:51:29.541 --> 00:51:32.333
“I’ll kill myself. I feel suffocated.”

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.833
In that house and in your presence,

00:51:43.041 --> 00:51:44.416
she was assaulted.

00:51:45.083 --> 00:51:46.541
Beaten and abused.

00:51:47.166 --> 00:51:48.666
But rather than helping her,

00:51:49.583 --> 00:51:51.166
you made her a scapegoat?

00:51:51.708 --> 00:51:54.458
-I never said Radha played any part in it.
-But you did.

00:51:57.166 --> 00:51:58.750
And I’m sure she was complicit.

00:52:00.666 --> 00:52:01.791
Had I wanted to kill him,

00:52:02.416 --> 00:52:05.708
why would I do that after the wedding
and not before?

00:52:07.166 --> 00:52:12.791
Maybe the victim found out
about you and Radha.

00:52:15.125 --> 00:52:16.791
Property, land, your share in it...

00:52:17.708 --> 00:52:20.416
-you could see yourself losing everything.
-Bullshit.

00:52:22.125 --> 00:52:24.666
My uncle left me more than his son.

00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:27.750
-His own son!
-Well, everyone makes mistakes.

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:31.750
Anyway, let it be.

00:52:35.625 --> 00:52:38.291
I know where you were
between 11:00 p.m. and midnight.

00:52:39.791 --> 00:52:40.625
Before that?

00:52:41.916 --> 00:52:42.875
M.G. Road.

00:52:43.291 --> 00:52:45.041
Your cell location says otherwise.

00:52:45.958 --> 00:52:48.041
Belaghat, the murder location.

00:52:48.541 --> 00:52:50.791
The cell location
is indicative, Inspector...

00:52:51.958 --> 00:52:52.791
not exact.

00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:55.583
The trains come and go
at the railway crossing.

00:52:56.166 --> 00:52:57.083
I was stuck there.

00:53:03.375 --> 00:53:04.875
You have all the answers, don't you?

00:53:07.541 --> 00:53:09.583
Tell me, how did you used to meet Radha?

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:14.041
Every day... under the same roof?

00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:17.458
Shall I tell you?

00:53:19.875 --> 00:53:21.958
You’d take the back stairs.

00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:28.416
Probably took them that night as well.

00:53:28.875 --> 00:53:30.041
Maybe you got caught.

00:53:31.875 --> 00:53:34.416
After killing him, a bit later...

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:41.208
you entered through the front door,
took everyone, and left for the temple.

00:53:44.375 --> 00:53:45.208
Yes.

00:53:47.541 --> 00:53:50.125
And then... his ghost called my phone.

00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:56.291
Get some evidence.

00:54:00.666 --> 00:54:02.166
When you know they were both involved…

00:54:03.083 --> 00:54:04.666
why didn't you bring the girl in?

00:54:05.291 --> 00:54:07.541
Vikram would've walked free
like he did today.

00:54:07.958 --> 00:54:08.916
She would not.

00:54:12.333 --> 00:54:13.291
Poor girl.

00:54:14.541 --> 00:54:15.875
What did she even do?

00:54:17.166 --> 00:54:20.083
Just screwed both the uncle
and nephew under the same roof.

00:54:20.833 --> 00:54:22.500
I know what she is.

00:54:23.666 --> 00:54:26.125
But we're investigating a murder,
not her character.

00:54:26.208 --> 00:54:27.458
She is stringing you along.

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:30.375
Not at all.

00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:33.833
She hardly even looks at me.

00:54:33.916 --> 00:54:35.666
That's how girls do it.

00:54:36.708 --> 00:54:39.125
If you want to get a man’s attention,
then ignore him.

00:54:40.125 --> 00:54:42.291
He gets intrigued.

00:54:42.375 --> 00:54:45.833
Now… that woman ignores you,

00:54:47.041 --> 00:54:47.958
and what happened?

00:54:48.041 --> 00:54:50.541
You got intrigued, didn’t you?

00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:54.166
That is what is called a ‘tease’.

00:54:55.041 --> 00:54:56.541
For instance, my wife.

00:54:57.166 --> 00:54:59.333
For three days, she is saying no--

00:54:59.416 --> 00:55:00.916
Have you read the fingerprint file?

00:55:02.291 --> 00:55:05.166
I already told you,
no fingerprints were found on the gun.

00:55:05.583 --> 00:55:06.625
Not the gun.

00:55:07.666 --> 00:55:09.250
I'm talking about Raghubeer's phone.

00:55:10.208 --> 00:55:12.291
-Whose fingerprints are on it?
-No one's.

00:55:13.958 --> 00:55:18.125
If Raghubeer called Vikram,
where are his fingerprints?

00:55:21.208 --> 00:55:22.666
-Where?
-You tell me.

00:56:10.333 --> 00:56:13.291
I was passing by,
so I thought I'd ask you a few questions.

00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:16.583
-About what, sir?
-Can I have some water first?

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.208
You're my informer.

00:56:21.833 --> 00:56:23.916
The only one who can get me
the inside scoop.

00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:26.583
These rich folks won't associate with us.

00:56:27.625 --> 00:56:29.000
I also don't know anything, sir.

00:56:30.541 --> 00:56:33.875
Well, at least tell me
how the new mistress is doing.

00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:50.416
You two seem to be thick as thieves.

00:56:51.291 --> 00:56:53.750
She wasn't much older than me
when she was brought here.

00:56:54.875 --> 00:56:56.083
She would cry everyday.

00:56:57.208 --> 00:56:59.125
Now she has confined herself up there.

00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:01.625
Mistress, my foot!

00:57:06.125 --> 00:57:08.291
She doesn't even have a man
in her life now.

00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:10.416
God knows how she will hold out.

00:57:12.875 --> 00:57:14.083
How do you hold out?

00:57:16.791 --> 00:57:17.916
You live alone too.

00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:21.000
You work all day earning a living.

00:57:22.416 --> 00:57:25.833
My grandma here, with the sickle,
protects me.

00:57:37.333 --> 00:57:38.875
Chunni, who killed the Thakur?

00:57:43.625 --> 00:57:44.458
Sir...

00:57:44.958 --> 00:57:48.125
That night, you called Vikram
from Raghubeer's cell phone.

00:57:52.416 --> 00:57:53.416
No, sir.

00:57:53.958 --> 00:57:54.916
I saw you.

00:57:56.416 --> 00:57:57.291
On the camera.

00:57:58.458 --> 00:58:00.833
As the lights went off,
you went upstairs with a lantern.

00:58:04.208 --> 00:58:05.083
Yes, sir, I did.

00:58:06.166 --> 00:58:07.083
Why didn't you tell me?

00:58:09.708 --> 00:58:10.625
I forgot, sir.

00:58:15.916 --> 00:58:17.250
What did you see upstairs?

00:58:20.666 --> 00:58:21.750
Should I remind you?

00:58:26.291 --> 00:58:27.750
The Thakur was on a call.

00:58:28.583 --> 00:58:31.208
I put the lantern in the room
and went downstairs.

00:58:32.375 --> 00:58:34.458
Later, Vicky sir returned
and found the body.

00:58:34.541 --> 00:58:35.458
Another lie.

00:58:37.875 --> 00:58:42.041
The lantern was not in the Thakur's room.
It was smashed on the stairs.

00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:44.583
How?

00:58:46.541 --> 00:58:48.166
You went upstairs with the lantern.

00:58:48.958 --> 00:58:50.541
You saw the Thakur lying dead.

00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:52.958
You rushed downstairs...

00:58:53.833 --> 00:58:55.750
and the lantern slipped from your hands.

00:58:57.208 --> 00:58:58.166
Who was up there?

00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:01.333
Vikram Singh?

00:59:04.958 --> 00:59:06.750
Fine, go ahead, help Vikram.

00:59:10.458 --> 00:59:13.750
You and that foolish woman,
you will both get caught.

00:59:16.791 --> 00:59:18.000
I won't make it out alive.

00:59:18.958 --> 00:59:20.666
If I tell you anything, they'll kill me.

00:59:23.666 --> 00:59:24.916
You will come to no harm.

00:59:26.208 --> 00:59:28.666
But I can only help you
if you tell me the truth.

00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:30.166
You won't be able to, sir.

00:59:30.958 --> 00:59:32.458
They finished my father too.

00:59:33.916 --> 00:59:36.000
Your father was killed
in a robbery, wasn't he?

00:59:37.791 --> 00:59:39.666
Along with the Thakur's wife?

00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:41.541
My father called me that night.

00:59:42.958 --> 00:59:44.875
He said he'd be back in two hours.

00:59:45.791 --> 00:59:47.416
He left Gwalior at night.

00:59:51.666 --> 00:59:53.166
Why would someone kill your father?

00:59:54.458 --> 00:59:56.166
How would I know, sir?

00:59:57.375 --> 00:59:59.958
If my report was investigated,
then maybe I would.

01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:04.208
But your senior officer,
along with these people, closed the case.

01:00:08.791 --> 01:00:10.000
Do you know what you're saying?

01:00:10.875 --> 01:00:12.041
Look at my grandmother.

01:00:13.083 --> 01:00:15.791
She’s gone insane trying to find out
what happened, for years.

01:00:17.583 --> 01:00:21.166
She never got to see the body,
so she refuses to believe it.

01:01:39.125 --> 01:01:41.458
You send it immediately.
I'll talk to you later.

01:01:42.875 --> 01:01:45.041
It's Ramdeen's missing report, the FIR.

01:01:45.416 --> 01:01:47.958
-Whose?
-Chunni's father, the driver Ramdeen.

01:01:48.416 --> 01:01:52.125
He called home from the road and said
he'd be back in two hours. Read it.

01:01:54.166 --> 01:01:55.791
So he was near Kanpur.

01:01:55.875 --> 01:01:58.875
I called every police station
within a two hour radius.

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:03.000
A car of the same description
was reported at Akbarpur station

01:02:03.083 --> 01:02:04.000
the very next day.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.958
Akbarpur is situated
between Gwalior and Kanpur.

01:02:18.250 --> 01:02:19.083
Sir.

01:02:22.916 --> 01:02:25.416
Go to Munna Raja's place
tomorrow morning...

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.875
and apologize for what you did
to Vikram Singh.

01:02:30.291 --> 01:02:31.958
Go and say, "Sir...

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:34.666
I made a mistake. I'm sorry."

01:02:36.041 --> 01:02:36.916
And mean it.

01:02:38.166 --> 01:02:39.666
Sir, I sought your advice

01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:42.166
and you told me to work without fear.
So that’s what I’m doing.

01:02:43.291 --> 01:02:46.041
You are working recklessly.

01:02:47.416 --> 01:02:50.125
You, sir, are a servant of the state.

01:02:51.625 --> 01:02:52.583
And he is the state.

01:02:53.583 --> 01:02:57.583
No investigation, no evidence
just beating a hollow drum for no reason.

01:02:57.875 --> 01:03:01.416
Sir... Vikram Singh's phone location
was in Belaghat,

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.208
and he says he was at M.G. Road.

01:03:03.625 --> 01:03:06.416
And then,
there’s the property angle as well.

01:03:08.166 --> 01:03:11.083
-That's not enough. Find something else.
-Sir, that girl, Chunni...

01:03:12.708 --> 01:03:13.833
she knows something.

01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:18.458
Servants, they see everything.
She will talk.

01:03:22.916 --> 01:03:23.916
Go ahead.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:24.958
Sir...

01:03:29.041 --> 01:03:29.916
What is it?

01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:35.666
The case of Raghubeer Singh's wife
and the driver...

01:03:39.333 --> 01:03:41.208
was it a robbery or something else?

01:03:42.333 --> 01:03:43.166
Meaning?

01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:46.666
I mean, in armed robbery cases,
you usually find the body or the car.

01:03:47.375 --> 01:03:50.833
But nothing was found in this case
and there wasn't any report either.

01:03:52.625 --> 01:03:54.708
Or maybe we missed something.

01:04:08.375 --> 01:04:12.875
AKBARPUR POLICE STATION

01:04:52.958 --> 01:04:55.666
All this was recovered
from the same accident site.

01:04:58.666 --> 01:05:00.750
This stuff doesn’t look like
it belongs to the car.

01:05:02.583 --> 01:05:03.708
A truck, maybe.

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:06.250
Yes. It was a hit-and-run case, right?

01:05:07.083 --> 01:05:09.958
The other vehicle's debris
is also kept in this evidence box.

01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:50.125
JAJMAU - KANPUR

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:05.291
JEHANGIR TANNERY
JAJMAU, KANPUR

01:06:26.458 --> 01:06:27.583
What do you want, sir?

01:06:29.541 --> 01:06:31.416
Your boss, who runs this place.

01:06:31.833 --> 01:06:34.041
The boss? He lives close by.

01:06:34.375 --> 01:06:37.958
He lives at his butcher's shop,
behind the Jinnato Mosque.

01:06:38.583 --> 01:06:41.875
I’m asking you about the owner
and you're sending me to the butcher shop.

01:06:42.583 --> 01:06:44.541
It is owned by an MLA, sir.

01:06:44.625 --> 01:06:47.166
Who wants associate their name
with a tannery?

01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:52.375
What happened, sir?

01:07:12.333 --> 01:07:13.833
Where can I find the Jehangir Tannery guy?

01:07:13.916 --> 01:07:15.416
Around that corner.

01:07:45.458 --> 01:07:46.958
Do you run Jehangir Tannery?

01:07:50.458 --> 01:07:52.291
I've heard you run it for an MLA.

01:07:55.041 --> 01:07:55.958
What's his name?

01:08:01.125 --> 01:08:04.875
Tell your boss to show up
at Belaghat police station tomorrow.

01:08:37.416 --> 01:08:41.125
{\an8}MLA - MUNNA RAJA

01:09:03.708 --> 01:09:06.125
Just like milk has water,
water has bacteria,

01:09:06.208 --> 01:09:08.250
and our body has bacteria in it.

01:09:08.958 --> 01:09:12.958
Similarly, terrorists and their community
blend in our society...

01:09:13.583 --> 01:09:17.666
then, from society to our streets
and then to our homes.

01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:22.416
Homosexual relationships
violate the law of nature.

01:09:22.833 --> 01:09:26.791
The next 20 years will see
an alarming rise in such abnormalities.

01:09:33.833 --> 01:09:36.791
Sir, I've been instructed by my senior
to report here.

01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:43.375
Well, Vikram Singh
is your future son-in-law, so...

01:09:45.666 --> 01:09:46.500
forgive him.

01:09:47.791 --> 01:09:49.541
When are you arresting that woman?

01:09:51.958 --> 01:09:53.666
Show some force, she’ll spill everything.

01:09:54.166 --> 01:09:55.750
Yes, sir. You're right.

01:09:56.916 --> 01:09:58.708
But what she will spill may...

01:10:01.375 --> 01:10:03.458
damage the family's prestige.

01:10:06.625 --> 01:10:08.250
You need to rehearse a bit more.

01:10:09.166 --> 01:10:10.541
Go on. I'll call you later.

01:10:11.333 --> 01:10:12.166
Okay.

01:10:13.333 --> 01:10:14.333
It was good.

01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:22.041
Sir, you knew about the two of them
all along? Vikram Singh and--

01:10:22.125 --> 01:10:23.041
Do you know...

01:10:25.541 --> 01:10:28.791
what it takes to go
from whore to homemaker?

01:10:31.416 --> 01:10:33.375
She knows men inside out.

01:10:35.458 --> 01:10:38.833
Be it Vikram Singh... or anyone else.

01:10:41.416 --> 01:10:43.541
Heard you took a trip to Jajmau yesterday.

01:10:43.875 --> 01:10:44.708
Yes, sir.

01:10:51.208 --> 01:10:53.833
What were you inquiring about
at Jehangir Tannery?

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.791
I was there
only to inquire about Raghubeer Singh.

01:10:57.791 --> 01:11:01.541
Maybe... I had the wrong information.

01:11:01.625 --> 01:11:04.291
You've got informers
in the mansion too, I've heard.

01:11:06.458 --> 01:11:08.625
The SSP has high hopes for you.

01:11:10.125 --> 01:11:11.375
So show a little force.

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.166
-Understand?
-Yes, sir.

01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:23.375
It's a simple case. A man was murdered
by his wife and her lover.

01:11:23.791 --> 01:11:26.666
But instead,
we are chasing conspiracy theories

01:11:27.541 --> 01:11:29.541
You see only two suspects, don't you?

01:11:30.375 --> 01:11:32.666
Do you know
that Munna Raja is involved

01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:34.916
in Raghubeer Singh's first wife's murder?

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:36.875
-Munna Raja?
-Yes.

01:11:39.875 --> 01:11:42.666
It was a case of hit-and-run,
not highway robbery.

01:11:43.083 --> 01:11:45.458
And you want me
to leave all the investigation,

01:11:45.541 --> 01:11:47.708
put that girl behind bars
and get it over with.

01:11:49.166 --> 01:11:51.541
I didn't even know anything
about the victim.

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:54.875
What kind of person was he?
Why was he murdered?

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.333
What kind of person was your father?
How would you describe him?

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.458
He used to traffic girls into his home.

01:12:16.583 --> 01:12:18.500
What do you think he was like?

01:12:20.125 --> 01:12:21.208
Did it bother you?

01:12:21.833 --> 01:12:25.000
He never gave a damn
about anyone's sentiments.

01:12:26.208 --> 01:12:29.875
He did as he pleased.
No one had the guts to stand up to him.

01:12:32.583 --> 01:12:33.458
And your mother?

01:12:34.875 --> 01:12:35.833
She was scared.

01:12:36.875 --> 01:12:38.166
She was terrified of him.

01:12:38.791 --> 01:12:41.666
Still, living with such a woman
in the family...

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:43.666
There was no family.

01:12:44.125 --> 01:12:46.500
Karan was in boarding school
from the beginning.

01:12:46.791 --> 01:12:48.208
Then, after my marriage...

01:12:48.958 --> 01:12:51.333
my father and grandma...

01:12:52.041 --> 01:12:54.083
were the only ones left.

01:13:01.666 --> 01:13:05.041
What about his brother's family?
I mean, your cousins...

01:13:06.375 --> 01:13:08.041
Vasudha and... what's-his-name?

01:13:08.125 --> 01:13:09.291
-Vikram.
-Yes, Vikram.

01:13:10.458 --> 01:13:12.833
They moved out a few years ago.

01:13:13.583 --> 01:13:15.750
Karan and Vasudha were in boarding school.

01:13:16.291 --> 01:13:19.583
They used to visit on holidays,
but not every year.

01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:21.583
That means...

01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:27.083
it was after a long time
that you all met at the wedding. Right?

01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:44.083
What do you think?

01:13:48.458 --> 01:13:49.583
Who killed him?

01:14:00.041 --> 01:14:03.125
Vikram worked with my father most closely.

01:14:04.416 --> 01:14:06.083
The business, property...

01:14:08.208 --> 01:14:10.791
and you know the rest.

01:14:17.625 --> 01:14:18.833
Can I have some water?

01:14:19.375 --> 01:14:21.000
Yes, of course. Get some water.

01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:32.875
Pramila aunty keeps an eye on me
all the time.

01:14:32.958 --> 01:14:35.958
She can do anything for her son.
I have serious doubts...

01:14:45.041 --> 01:14:47.958
I told you,
you should take care of yourself.

01:14:48.791 --> 01:14:51.666
-Come on, sit.
-I was about to get it.

01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:53.375
But you didn't, did you?

01:14:53.458 --> 01:14:55.541
Instead you’re having a long conversation
with him.

01:14:56.166 --> 01:14:58.916
Why, dear? There's no man at home

01:14:59.708 --> 01:15:02.208
yet you let him in without my permission?

01:15:05.083 --> 01:15:07.875
Now when they return from last rites,

01:15:08.875 --> 01:15:10.875
I will have to tell Ravi...

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:12.916
what you’ve been up to.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:18.875
Wait, aunty!

01:15:21.708 --> 01:15:23.291
You also have to talk to him.

01:15:27.208 --> 01:15:29.625
Or I'd feel like you're hiding
something from me.

01:15:29.958 --> 01:15:32.083
Mummy stayed back here
just for you guys.

01:15:32.166 --> 01:15:34.875
-She does so much for you and you--
-I didn't call her.

01:15:35.541 --> 01:15:37.541
I’m sick of the two of you.

01:15:38.208 --> 01:15:40.000
-You are just jealous!
-Sudha!

01:15:53.708 --> 01:15:55.750
So, tell me...

01:15:57.583 --> 01:16:01.916
when and why did you move out?
You used to live here, didn't you?

01:16:04.291 --> 01:16:06.208
This won't go on for too long.

01:16:07.208 --> 01:16:09.666
Munna Raja is toying with you. Understand?

01:16:12.208 --> 01:16:13.041
Yes.

01:16:14.916 --> 01:16:18.958
Or maybe he wants to find out
who killed his friend.

01:16:20.375 --> 01:16:21.208
Or...

01:16:22.333 --> 01:16:26.333
who hated him so much,
that on the very night of his wedding…

01:16:31.833 --> 01:16:37.458
People with prosperity, reputation,
power, money…

01:16:38.583 --> 01:16:40.375
don’t inspire hate.

01:16:41.166 --> 01:16:44.208
They inspire envy. You won’t understand.

01:16:49.708 --> 01:16:52.375
-You used to live here, didn't you?
-Yes.

01:16:53.625 --> 01:16:55.250
Aren't you sad about his demise?

01:16:55.875 --> 01:16:58.458
The thing is,
I don't like unnecessary melodrama.

01:16:59.375 --> 01:17:01.583
I have always been at the hostel
or my home.

01:17:02.458 --> 01:17:04.625
I didn’t know him well enough
to feign grief.

01:17:11.125 --> 01:17:13.875
I had a look at your FIR
and started the investigation.

01:17:15.541 --> 01:17:18.250
Soon I will reach a conclusion.

01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:28.041
But for that to happen...

01:17:30.083 --> 01:17:31.916
you will have to help me too.

01:17:52.083 --> 01:17:53.541
So this is Kamla Kumari?

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:56.500
Looks tough.

01:17:58.416 --> 01:18:00.666
But my skin isn’t too thin either.

01:18:01.708 --> 01:18:04.708
-Not taking me to the police station?
-If the case drags on…

01:18:06.875 --> 01:18:08.583
I'll have to do that, too. Don't worry.

01:18:12.458 --> 01:18:15.166
I already told you everything
that happened that night.

01:18:16.791 --> 01:18:19.083
You know the rest of the story.

01:18:26.625 --> 01:18:30.958
Didn't Raghubeer Singh ever suspect
your relationship with Vikram Singh?

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.125
You’re pretty confident in your charade.

01:18:38.916 --> 01:18:43.625
If he had suspected, you'd have found
my body in that room, not his.

01:18:49.833 --> 01:18:53.500
Who could have killed him...
apart from you two?

01:18:58.750 --> 01:19:02.458
Could be anyone. Someone braver than me…

01:19:03.833 --> 01:19:05.541
Someone more desperate.

01:19:08.166 --> 01:19:09.916
But I don’t know anyone like that.

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:15.333
Bring the car around.

01:19:21.125 --> 01:19:21.958
You may go.

01:20:53.375 --> 01:20:54.333
The other day...

01:20:56.041 --> 01:20:57.750
why didn't you take me
to the police station?

01:21:00.375 --> 01:21:03.750
I took your friend.
Munna Raja bailed him out.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.916
Now, pinning the whole thing on you alone…

01:21:10.916 --> 01:21:12.625
is not something I would stoop to.

01:22:27.333 --> 01:22:28.625
Yes, hello?

01:22:33.625 --> 01:22:34.625
What?

01:23:09.666 --> 01:23:11.791
These two fingers look fractured.

01:23:13.083 --> 01:23:14.875
And look at the neck here.

01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:16.916
Strangulation marks.

01:23:17.791 --> 01:23:21.416
She was strangled to death, Inspector.
It's a murder.

01:23:35.333 --> 01:23:38.375
Chunni!

01:23:38.875 --> 01:23:40.375
Chunni! My child!

01:23:40.708 --> 01:23:42.958
Chunni!

01:23:44.458 --> 01:23:46.750
Chunni! Where are you taking her?

01:23:46.833 --> 01:23:47.791
My child!

01:23:48.250 --> 01:23:49.875
Chunni! Leave me!

01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:52.916
Chunni!

01:24:02.625 --> 01:24:04.166
Oh, my God! Chunni!

01:24:09.416 --> 01:24:14.000
My Chunni! My Chunni is no more!

01:24:14.125 --> 01:24:18.833
-Ma'am, leave him.
-My Chunni is no more!

01:24:18.916 --> 01:24:20.708
My Chunni is no more!

01:24:23.833 --> 01:24:24.666
Nandu...

01:24:25.583 --> 01:24:27.458
remember Munna Raja’s man
in Jajmau…

01:24:29.291 --> 01:24:30.291
let’s pick him up.

01:24:30.375 --> 01:24:32.083
Make him sing.

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:49.625
-What happened? Broke down again?
-Your brains have broken down.

01:24:51.416 --> 01:24:53.500
You can't see what's happening
right in front of you.

01:24:53.583 --> 01:24:54.583
What the fuck are you saying?

01:24:56.291 --> 01:24:59.166
That woman, along with her lover,
committed the murder. It’s obvious.

01:24:59.791 --> 01:25:03.166
But instead of going after her,
you’re making me run around in circles.

01:25:03.250 --> 01:25:05.500
You’re not thinking from up here
but from down there.

01:25:05.583 --> 01:25:08.250
That bitch has turned your brains to mush.

01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:10.958
You wear the uniform…

01:25:11.458 --> 01:25:14.750
but you can't investigate to save your
life. You’re a fucking idiot. An idiot.

01:25:15.166 --> 01:25:18.416
Fine. But even as an idiot,
I'm far better than you.

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:22.083
I married a nice, respected girl. I’m not
chasing a fucking streetwalker like you.

01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:25.875
Get lost!

01:25:41.333 --> 01:25:42.708
In broad daylight…

01:25:43.875 --> 01:25:45.666
you two were brawling with each other.

01:25:46.375 --> 01:25:50.500
All the criminals in town are dead.
So cops have to beat each other up now?

01:25:50.583 --> 01:25:52.583
Sir, it wasn't my fault. He provoked me.

01:25:52.666 --> 01:25:55.083
-Listen...
-Sir, he called me moron. Ask him.

01:25:55.166 --> 01:25:57.000
-He insulted me.
-Narendra Singh...

01:25:57.083 --> 01:25:58.958
-I'm saying control yourself.
-Sir...

01:25:59.958 --> 01:26:01.833
Sir, I don't want to work with him.

01:26:02.125 --> 01:26:03.541
Narendra Singh, please go out.

01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:13.875
Jatil Yadav...

01:26:16.041 --> 01:26:20.333
You will file a written explanation
of your conduct.

01:26:20.916 --> 01:26:25.625
And then you can take leave,
or I can suspend you. What will it be?

01:26:26.083 --> 01:26:27.958
I knew this day
would definitely come, sir.

01:26:29.958 --> 01:26:31.291
I won't give in so easily.

01:26:31.916 --> 01:26:34.458
A child has been murdered.
I won't let it go in vain.

01:26:34.541 --> 01:26:36.833
And now,
I’m going to get to the bottom of this.

01:26:38.791 --> 01:26:39.666
<i>Jai Hind,</i> sir.

01:27:53.625 --> 01:27:55.708
How many times should I tell you
not to disturb me?

01:27:55.791 --> 01:27:57.666
Nandu, I was attacked.

01:27:58.666 --> 01:28:02.208
They were following me
from the headquarters, fired shots at me.

01:28:02.291 --> 01:28:04.833
You must be wounded, then?
Must have bled a lot?

01:28:04.916 --> 01:28:06.791
<i>-Should I send an ambulance?</i>
-Nandu!

01:28:06.875 --> 01:28:09.125
No, I’m an idiot, right.
I’ll believe anything you say.

01:28:09.208 --> 01:28:12.166
You say you got attacked, you got shot.
I'll believe everything.

01:28:12.250 --> 01:28:13.083
Listen to me.

01:28:13.208 --> 01:28:15.666
Listen, they’re going to arrest her
tomorrow morning.

01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:17.750
<i>Once in custody,</i>
<i>she’ll sing like a canary.</i>

01:28:17.833 --> 01:28:18.666
You’re making a mistake.

01:28:18.750 --> 01:28:22.375
In fact, the SSP and Ravi Sisodiya
are having a meeting, as we speak.

01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:25.166
Her time’s up.

01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:42.583
<i>Hello?</i>

01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:22.291
Stop, you bitch! Stop!

01:29:22.875 --> 01:29:25.541
You want a share of the property?

01:29:27.958 --> 01:29:32.000
-Stop. Open the door!
-What's going on?

01:29:32.125 --> 01:29:34.291
Fuck her! I will kill her today!

01:29:34.375 --> 01:29:35.833
What's going on?

01:29:35.916 --> 01:29:39.000
-Move!
-Have you lost it? What's happening?

01:29:39.333 --> 01:29:41.291
-Open the door!
-What, are you going to kill her?

01:29:41.375 --> 01:29:45.750
Move it! Fuck her! I'll kill her today!

01:32:53.166 --> 01:32:55.750
You came looking for them that day,
didn't you?

01:32:56.916 --> 01:33:02.000
I will melt your flesh and bury you
right there with them. You hear me?

01:33:38.666 --> 01:33:41.458
<i>Wake up</i>

01:33:44.458 --> 01:33:47.791
<i>Wake up</i>

01:33:50.875 --> 01:33:54.041
<i>Wake up</i>

01:33:57.791 --> 01:34:01.708
<i>Wake up</i>

01:34:09.333 --> 01:34:11.583
<i>Wake up</i>

01:34:12.041 --> 01:34:18.166
<i>The dawn steals into the city of dark</i>

01:34:18.291 --> 01:34:20.083
It's me.

01:34:24.583 --> 01:34:27.375
<i>Wake up</i>

01:34:27.458 --> 01:34:29.458
<i>The dawn steals...</i>

01:34:29.541 --> 01:34:30.375
Come.

01:34:30.458 --> 01:34:34.708
<i>...Into the city of dark</i>

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.208
<i>Wake up</i>

01:34:39.291 --> 01:34:46.250
<i>A patch of light in the cloth of the night</i>

01:34:58.208 --> 01:34:59.666
He used to keep me here...

01:35:00.708 --> 01:35:02.333
whenever he would visit Gwalior.

01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:07.208
Raghubeer's family must be knowing
about it

01:35:07.833 --> 01:35:08.666
No.

01:35:09.833 --> 01:35:11.541
No one from the family comes here.

01:35:13.416 --> 01:35:15.041
Only Karan visited once.

01:35:19.833 --> 01:35:20.833
These...

01:35:22.583 --> 01:35:24.000
What about these people?

01:35:25.041 --> 01:35:28.583
They were hired to guard
the house and me.

01:35:30.666 --> 01:35:32.916
Their situation is as bad as mine.

01:35:34.416 --> 01:35:35.708
They won't tell anyone.

01:35:39.583 --> 01:35:40.666
Get some rest.

01:35:45.166 --> 01:35:46.791
You could have run away from me.

01:35:51.291 --> 01:35:52.875
For a minute, I thought...

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.375
you left me and went away.

01:35:56.791 --> 01:35:58.041
I should have.

01:36:01.791 --> 01:36:04.791
-You have no respect for me anyway.
-I do.

01:36:05.333 --> 01:36:07.500
For your courage and honesty.

01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:10.875
What honesty?

01:36:12.583 --> 01:36:13.541
I'm a whore.

01:36:14.625 --> 01:36:15.458
A murderer.

01:36:32.666 --> 01:36:33.500
Why?

01:36:44.125 --> 01:36:45.083
Right.

01:36:47.625 --> 01:36:49.750
I’m too simple for you.

01:36:57.250 --> 01:36:58.708
I’ve become numb.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.375
Dr. Joshi...

01:37:13.083 --> 01:37:16.833
you have stated here that dead skin
was found in Chunni's nails.

01:37:16.916 --> 01:37:18.333
Yes, dead skin.

01:37:19.166 --> 01:37:20.583
In these fingernails.

01:37:21.833 --> 01:37:22.833
What do you mean?

01:37:23.416 --> 01:37:26.583
The murderer's skin is damaged,
Narendra Singh.

01:37:27.583 --> 01:37:31.750
We have found a layer
of the murderer's epidermis in her nails.

01:37:32.541 --> 01:37:33.458
You see,

01:37:33.541 --> 01:37:38.291
she may have scratched the murderer
while struggling.

01:37:52.875 --> 01:37:55.333
-<i>Jai Hind.</i>
-Ajay, is the chief inside?

01:37:55.416 --> 01:37:57.666
He is in a meeting. Please wait a little.

01:39:22.708 --> 01:39:26.666
Your granddaughter, Chunni…I’ve come
to enquire about her case.

01:39:34.166 --> 01:39:35.000
Look at this.

01:39:36.083 --> 01:39:37.791
This is Munna Raja.

01:39:39.541 --> 01:39:41.333
And his man over here, behind him.

01:39:43.125 --> 01:39:44.083
Do you know him?

01:39:46.291 --> 01:39:47.791
Have you seen him around?

01:39:50.291 --> 01:39:53.291
Did he have anything against you
or your granddaughter?

01:39:56.208 --> 01:39:57.083
Ma'am!

01:40:50.291 --> 01:40:52.000
You were in that room that night?

01:41:01.833 --> 01:41:04.416
What the hell? Leave me!

01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:10.541
You and Vikram did it, right?

01:41:10.625 --> 01:41:13.625
You dragged Chunni into this too.
That's why she got killed.

01:41:14.375 --> 01:41:15.583
Isn't that so?

01:41:19.291 --> 01:41:21.041
I kept protecting you...

01:41:21.625 --> 01:41:23.333
kept trusting you and you...

01:41:24.041 --> 01:41:27.166
you kept lying to me.

01:41:32.875 --> 01:41:33.875
Yes, I lied.

01:41:38.166 --> 01:41:39.250
What could I do?

01:41:41.791 --> 01:41:42.916
<i>I used to think...</i>

01:41:43.916 --> 01:41:46.041
<i>Vikram didn't have the guts</i>
<i>to do anything.</i>

01:41:47.375 --> 01:41:48.458
<i>Turned out...</i>

01:41:50.333 --> 01:41:51.708
<i>he never had the intention.</i>

01:42:03.166 --> 01:42:04.333
Let's talk later.

01:42:34.041 --> 01:42:35.333
I said we'll speak later.

01:42:35.416 --> 01:42:38.708
Why leave it for later,
when we can settle this tonight?

01:42:39.291 --> 01:42:42.833
<i>-I'm going to tell him everything.</i>
-Radha, listen to me.

01:42:44.833 --> 01:42:45.666
Radha!

01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:32.333
-Radha, wait. Listen to me.
-Listen to you?

01:43:33.291 --> 01:43:36.916
Weren’t you going to run away with me
today? You told me to pack my bags.

01:43:37.958 --> 01:43:40.625
That can't happen. Where would I take you?

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.083
So you lied to me all this time?
You used me.

01:43:45.666 --> 01:43:47.208
Let’s not get into who used whom.

01:43:47.916 --> 01:43:48.916
You stay here!

01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:51.333
I will take care of you.

01:43:51.416 --> 01:43:54.500
How generous of you.
But I’m not as noble as you.

01:43:54.583 --> 01:43:57.583
What’s done is done. But shamelessly
parading your fiancee around--

01:44:02.583 --> 01:44:03.458
Yes, brother-in-law?

01:44:04.166 --> 01:44:05.500
Yes, I'm on my way.

01:44:05.958 --> 01:44:08.083
Yes, take care of it. I'll be there soon.

01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:10.166
It will take a little while.

01:44:11.625 --> 01:44:12.583
Radha!

01:44:13.166 --> 01:44:16.291
-Please forgive me. I made a mistake.
-Uncle, let me explain.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:42.833
Go!

01:44:45.125 --> 01:44:45.958
Go!

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.833
<i>Vikram sent me downstairs.</i>

01:44:53.291 --> 01:44:54.666
<i>After I left,</i>

01:44:55.375 --> 01:44:56.916
<i>What he said to Chunni...</i>

01:44:58.125 --> 01:44:59.291
<i>I don't know...</i>

01:45:00.083 --> 01:45:02.083
<i>but she didn't say anything to anyone.</i>

01:45:04.291 --> 01:45:06.208
God knows where Vikram is.

01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:10.500
Watch it!

01:45:12.875 --> 01:45:15.291
What are you doing? Clean it.

01:45:16.708 --> 01:45:22.416
<i>My beloved teases me</i>
<i>What do I do?</i>

01:45:22.750 --> 01:45:28.541
<i>I was twelve when I married and came here</i>

01:45:29.916 --> 01:45:35.708
<i>I was twelve when I married and came here</i>

01:45:36.083 --> 01:45:40.625
<i>My beloved teases me</i>
<i>What do I do...</i>

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.416
<i>After a little while,</i>
<i>Vikram came through the front door...</i>

01:45:46.541 --> 01:45:48.583
<i>and took all of us to the temple.</i>

01:45:48.666 --> 01:45:49.541
Shall we go?

01:45:50.666 --> 01:45:51.958
Enough. Let's go.

01:45:54.541 --> 01:45:56.500
<i>What could I possibly say after that?</i>

01:45:59.375 --> 01:46:00.500
And to whom?

01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:10.000
Who would believe me?

01:46:19.625 --> 01:46:21.333
-Yes, Nandu?
-You were right.

01:46:22.291 --> 01:46:24.916
Munna Raja’s man killed Chunni.

01:46:25.083 --> 01:46:27.541
<i>The post-mortem report says</i>
<i>there was dead skin under her nails.</i>

01:46:27.958 --> 01:46:29.958
And his hands have scratch marks.

01:46:31.416 --> 01:46:32.875
I have seen it myself.

01:46:35.583 --> 01:46:37.708
He killed her to save Vikram Singh.

01:46:37.791 --> 01:46:38.625
<i>Exactly.</i>

01:46:41.208 --> 01:46:42.416
That child…

01:46:56.500 --> 01:46:57.333
Hello?

01:46:58.208 --> 01:47:00.416
I'm speaking from Morar Police Station,
in Gwalior.

01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:03.625
I have booked the suspect.
You should manage the hand-over.

01:47:08.125 --> 01:47:09.083
So...

01:47:10.791 --> 01:47:12.666
Jatil Yadav is sending the girl back.

01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:19.000
She’s of no use back here.

01:47:28.041 --> 01:47:32.708
<i>Weary, yet searching</i>

01:47:37.291 --> 01:47:42.208
<i>Weary, yet searching</i>

01:47:42.291 --> 01:47:47.041
<i>Knots of doubt, tying and untying</i>

01:47:47.125 --> 01:47:51.250
<i>Cutting down the threads of pain...</i>

01:47:53.625 --> 01:47:54.458
Hello?

01:47:55.458 --> 01:47:56.333
Hello?

01:47:57.666 --> 01:47:59.041
Hello, who is it?

01:48:01.166 --> 01:48:05.916
<i>Blow away the smoke,</i>
<i>Shatter the mirrors</i>

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:10.375
<i>Under the hollow skies</i>

01:48:10.458 --> 01:48:14.375
<i>On the beat that your heart skipped</i>

01:48:14.458 --> 01:48:15.791
<i>Spin</i>

01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:23.625
<i>Like a spinning wheel, spin</i>

01:48:25.291 --> 01:48:28.250
<i>Like a spinning wheel, spin </i>

01:48:34.750 --> 01:48:37.708
<i>Like a spinning wheel, spin</i>

01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:50.083
<i>Like a spinning wheel, spin</i>

01:49:00.791 --> 01:49:01.625
You?

01:49:12.458 --> 01:49:13.833
These are clinic bills.

01:49:14.458 --> 01:49:17.958
From the clinic where your sister
was admitted a day before her death.

01:49:20.250 --> 01:49:21.208
An abortion clinic.

01:49:22.083 --> 01:49:24.250
No. It's rubbish.

01:49:26.833 --> 01:49:28.708
My sister came here for Karan.

01:49:29.875 --> 01:49:32.125
And what about this report
and these bills?

01:49:34.875 --> 01:49:35.708
Listen...

01:49:37.125 --> 01:49:39.083
Karan suffered from malaria that year.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:43.041
He was here on leave from his school.
My sister was here too.

01:49:45.250 --> 01:49:47.166
You can confirm this with the school.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.291
I'm not lying.

01:50:03.333 --> 01:50:04.958
Is this your first time drinking?

01:50:08.625 --> 01:50:09.750
Your sister...

01:50:11.333 --> 01:50:13.458
why did she leave for Kanpur
late at night?

01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:19.125
Someone called her that night.

01:50:20.708 --> 01:50:24.791
She left. When she didn't return
after a few hours, I called her.

01:50:25.416 --> 01:50:26.791
She seemed quite tense.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.000
She said, "I'm going to Kanpur.
I'll call you when I get there."

01:50:34.250 --> 01:50:35.333
After that...

01:50:40.583 --> 01:50:41.750
Didn't you ask her...

01:50:45.875 --> 01:50:49.375
why she was leaving... all of a sudden?

01:50:50.166 --> 01:50:51.000
Absolutely.

01:50:51.958 --> 01:50:55.208
But she didn't answer me.
She was at the train station.

01:50:55.833 --> 01:50:58.500
With the sound of the train
and lots of noise,

01:50:58.916 --> 01:51:00.541
I couldn't really hear much.

01:51:08.125 --> 01:51:09.500
Why was she at the station?

01:51:12.291 --> 01:51:13.750
She was returning in her car, right?

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.125
I thought she went to the station first.

01:51:20.041 --> 01:51:21.916
I heard the sound of the train.

01:51:22.875 --> 01:51:24.833
When I asked where she was,
she hung up.

01:51:49.333 --> 01:51:50.750
Madam ordered me...

01:51:52.166 --> 01:51:54.125
that if the Thakur brought a woman here

01:51:54.916 --> 01:51:56.250
I should inform her.

01:52:03.291 --> 01:52:04.750
Who did Raghubeer bring?

01:52:05.916 --> 01:52:07.625
You think he would give me a name?

01:52:09.375 --> 01:52:12.625
But yes... they would often
spend the night here.

01:52:14.750 --> 01:52:15.708
Open the bungalow.

01:52:16.333 --> 01:52:20.750
<i>Take a thread of doubt</i>
<i>A thread of illusion</i>

01:52:20.833 --> 01:52:27.291

<i>Take a thread of doubt</i>
<i>A thread of illusion</i>

01:52:37.375 --> 01:52:42.125
<i>And weave a cloth of misery</i>

01:52:42.208 --> 01:52:47.458
<i>The quilt of fate</i>
<i>Is bordered by frills of deception</i>

01:52:47.583 --> 01:52:51.583
<i>On the frill is a teardrop</i>

01:52:51.666 --> 01:52:55.083
<i>Crawling</i>

01:52:56.166 --> 01:53:00.500
<i>Weary, yet searching</i>

01:53:00.583 --> 01:53:05.375
<i>Crawling, breaking, mending</i>

01:53:07.875 --> 01:53:12.416
<i>Crawling, sleeping, waking</i>

01:53:12.541 --> 01:53:17.625
<i>Crawling, sleeping, waking</i>

01:53:17.708 --> 01:53:22.000
<i>Unanswered questions hang on pegs</i>

<i>Like a spinning wheel, spin</i>

<i>Like a feeling</i>
<i>In every pore of your body...</i>

01:54:15.166 --> 01:54:18.833
Nandu? No, forget that.
Take out the FIR filed by Chunni

01:54:19.666 --> 01:54:21.083
and tell me the date on it.

01:54:21.166 --> 01:54:25.541
<i>Like a feeling</i>

<i>But never dying, like an old habit</i>

01:55:03.083 --> 01:55:04.416
The SSP called me.

01:55:05.291 --> 01:55:08.291
I’ve been ordered to take the suspect
and wait under Jajmau bridge.

01:55:08.375 --> 01:55:11.541
<i>Like a spinning wheel, spin...</i>

01:55:11.958 --> 01:55:13.208
Okay, do as he says.

01:55:13.291 --> 01:55:16.666
<i>Like a spinning wheel, spin</i>

01:55:17.250 --> 01:55:24.208

{\an8}POLICE

01:58:53.375 --> 01:58:54.541
Easy.

01:58:57.208 --> 01:58:58.666
It's nothing.

01:59:02.791 --> 01:59:04.083
It didn't hit you.

01:59:04.750 --> 01:59:05.916
Just grazed you.

02:00:07.625 --> 02:00:12.416
No!

02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:46.583
Come over for Holi celebrations tomorrow.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.250
We'll form an alliance as we celebrate.

02:00:49.708 --> 02:00:52.750
No, not now.
I'm with my whole family right now.

02:00:53.250 --> 02:00:54.708
Let's meet and talk tomorrow.

02:00:55.208 --> 02:00:56.458
Yes. Bye.

02:00:57.791 --> 02:01:01.291
Yes, congratulations to you too. Bye.

02:01:04.291 --> 02:01:05.541
-Uncle.
-Yes?

02:01:06.208 --> 02:01:10.250
The factory you have in Belaghat.--

02:01:11.416 --> 02:01:12.541
Go, get the door.

02:01:13.458 --> 02:01:14.458
What about it?

02:01:14.875 --> 02:01:16.500
I mean...

02:01:17.458 --> 02:01:18.625
give some to me too.

02:01:19.958 --> 02:01:20.791
Give what?

02:01:21.250 --> 02:01:22.333
A share, what else?

02:01:22.791 --> 02:01:24.125
I serve you so well.

02:01:26.791 --> 02:01:29.458
Wipe your nose first. Share, indeed.

02:01:32.833 --> 02:01:33.833
Who is out there?

02:01:38.333 --> 02:01:40.000
Why did you let her in?

02:01:42.458 --> 02:01:43.583
I’m staying right here.

02:01:44.666 --> 02:01:46.041
Do whatever you want.

02:01:46.583 --> 02:01:47.416
Is that so?

02:01:51.833 --> 02:01:54.125
Has he left you?
The one you ran away with?

02:01:54.750 --> 02:01:55.916
Where did you run away to?

02:01:56.125 --> 02:01:57.000
Gwalior.

02:01:58.958 --> 02:02:01.625
Where you go every month
to give your brother-in-law his dose.

02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:07.291
Ravi Sisodiya was caught
giving drugs to your brother.

02:02:08.208 --> 02:02:10.583
The school informed your father too.

02:02:15.375 --> 02:02:17.041
Get out of here!

02:02:30.833 --> 02:02:32.083
What have you done, Ravi?

02:02:33.833 --> 02:02:35.833
You wanted a share in the property.

02:02:37.125 --> 02:02:40.208
-You murdered Raghubeer Singh?
-No.

02:02:40.875 --> 02:02:42.208
He didn’t commit the murder.

02:02:43.916 --> 02:02:45.625
That’s a whole other story.

02:02:48.541 --> 02:02:50.625
Which you know only too well, sir.

02:02:51.333 --> 02:02:53.833
Your man has probably been arrested
by now.

02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:56.750
An excavation at your tannery
will start tomorrow.

02:02:56.833 --> 02:02:58.583
That's where you disposed of the bodies

02:02:58.666 --> 02:03:01.375
of Mrs. Raghubeer Singh
and her driver, Ramdeen, right?

02:03:01.666 --> 02:03:02.916
What nonsense is this?

02:03:05.166 --> 02:03:07.833
Your mother and her driver...

02:03:09.125 --> 02:03:12.458
-are both buried in his tannery.
-This is bullshit.

02:03:14.375 --> 02:03:16.958
Vikram, son, bring the car around.

02:03:17.666 --> 02:03:18.875
I will deal with him.

02:03:19.916 --> 02:03:22.833
Vikram, didn't you hear what he said?

02:03:23.500 --> 02:03:24.875
Finish what you were saying.

02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:28.833
Munna Raja was behind
Mrs. Raghubeer Singh's murder.

02:03:28.916 --> 02:03:30.000
His man has confessed.

02:03:30.083 --> 02:03:31.458
You are lying.

02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:33.583
Motive?

02:03:35.291 --> 02:03:38.666
That night, Mrs. Raghubeer Singh
went to her husband's farmhouse.

02:03:41.416 --> 02:03:44.583
<i>She had her suspicions.</i>
<i>And she was right.</i>

02:03:51.291 --> 02:03:53.458
<i>The caretaker himself had called her.</i>

02:04:37.750 --> 02:04:40.500
<i>She saw Raghubeer Singh with your sister.</i>

02:04:41.541 --> 02:04:43.750
Vasudha Singh murdered her uncle.

02:04:50.791 --> 02:04:52.208
She was a minor back then.

02:04:54.458 --> 02:04:56.000
She was abused many times.

02:04:56.500 --> 02:04:59.583
We can build a case of self defence.

02:04:59.666 --> 02:05:02.208
but you’ll have to testify at the station.

02:05:02.583 --> 02:05:04.500
<i>She also had an abortion once.</i>

02:05:06.041 --> 02:05:10.375
<i>The principal suspended her</i>
<i>and informed her local guardian.</i>

02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:15.583
<i>And her local guardian</i>
<i>was Raghubeer Singh himself.</i>

02:05:17.291 --> 02:05:18.791
So that's the story you two have spun.

02:05:19.625 --> 02:05:23.208
The abortion was in the name
of Mrs. Raghubeer Singh on March 14th

02:05:23.291 --> 02:05:25.291
at the Sharma Nursing Home in Gwalior.

02:05:25.375 --> 02:05:27.875
On March 15th, your sister, Vasudha Singh,

02:05:27.958 --> 02:05:29.875
was expelled and on the same night...

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.583
Mrs. Raghubeer Singh her her driver disappear.

02:05:35.666 --> 02:05:37.958
Chunni filed an FIR the next day,

02:05:39.083 --> 02:05:42.833
on March 16th,
which was never investigated.

02:05:44.166 --> 02:05:45.041
So?

02:05:46.583 --> 02:05:47.541
What does that mean?

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:52.083
Vasudha Singh was expelled
because of her abortion.

02:05:52.750 --> 02:05:54.541
We have the principal's testimony,

02:05:54.958 --> 02:05:58.083
clinic bills, and the caretaker
has identified her.

02:05:58.375 --> 02:05:59.666
And most importantly...

02:06:01.333 --> 02:06:03.833
Her scarf, soaked in Raghubeer’s blood,

02:06:04.375 --> 02:06:06.416
which she hid in Radha's bag.

02:06:08.750 --> 02:06:11.333
Until 10:00 p.m.,
you were wearing the same scarf

02:06:11.416 --> 02:06:13.916
on which we found Raghubeer Singh's blood.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:16.500
And the murder was committed

02:06:17.083 --> 02:06:19.916
when only you were missing
from the wedding video.

02:06:20.958 --> 02:06:22.208
<i>And when you came back,</i>

02:06:23.666 --> 02:06:25.541
<i>you were wearing a different scarf.</i>

02:06:35.958 --> 02:06:36.958
Sudha?

02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:40.583
Vasudha...

02:06:41.583 --> 02:06:43.208
I've spoken to the magistrate.

02:06:44.541 --> 02:06:46.833
If you come with me in the morning--

02:06:46.916 --> 02:06:49.791
She won't go anywhere.
She hasn't done anything.

02:06:54.416 --> 02:06:57.708
Don't be afraid of him.
You'll be the one to put him behind bars.

02:06:58.958 --> 02:07:01.458
He is equally responsible
for your daughter's rape.

02:07:01.833 --> 02:07:03.208
He covered up the crime...

02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:06.791
and made sure the victim
didn't get any help.

02:07:18.458 --> 02:07:21.291
You’ll be stripped of your uniform
by tomorrow morning.

02:07:22.500 --> 02:07:24.333
-Let’s go, dear.
-Where are you going?

02:07:24.666 --> 02:07:27.791
-Let him go.
-We're breaking all ties with your family.

02:07:28.375 --> 02:07:29.416
Vikram!

02:07:32.541 --> 02:07:34.416
I’ll talk to him.

02:07:36.500 --> 02:07:37.666
I will.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:45.291
What do you think?

02:07:47.166 --> 02:07:50.000
Whom did Raghubeer’s wife call that night?

02:07:57.166 --> 02:07:59.000
Hello? Sister-in-law?

02:08:25.583 --> 02:08:27.791
She wanted to go back to her brother.

02:08:30.083 --> 02:08:32.125
-But your mother...
-Please!

02:08:33.666 --> 02:08:37.291
-begged her to return to Kanpur quietly.
-Please!

02:08:38.041 --> 02:08:39.875
And when she left Gwalior...

02:08:41.291 --> 02:08:44.291
That’s when your hallowed family
made its deal with the devil.

02:08:54.791 --> 02:08:55.875
So now...

02:08:58.958 --> 02:09:00.458
what do I tell Raghubeer?

02:09:02.041 --> 02:09:03.250
Sister-in-law...

02:09:07.250 --> 02:09:09.375
Sister-in-law is on her way from Gwalior.

02:09:13.833 --> 02:09:14.750
Now...

02:09:16.416 --> 02:09:18.291
you have persuaded me.

02:09:21.125 --> 02:09:21.958
Just...

02:09:24.041 --> 02:09:25.375
see what you can do about her.

02:09:44.125 --> 02:09:45.666
You think you are worthy...

02:09:46.750 --> 02:09:48.500
to be Raghubeer's heir, right?

02:09:52.875 --> 02:09:55.208
Your mother made a deal
with her daughter’s tormentor.

02:09:57.666 --> 02:09:58.625
She had me...

02:09:59.958 --> 02:10:02.750
arrange for this girl so that her own
daughter gets off the hook.

02:10:06.833 --> 02:10:08.041
Satisfied now?

02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:09.541
He is lying.

02:10:10.583 --> 02:10:11.750
This is all a lie.

02:10:12.083 --> 02:10:13.291
It's not true, Vikram.

02:10:14.291 --> 02:10:15.125
Vasudha...

02:10:19.166 --> 02:10:20.000
Dear...

02:10:24.041 --> 02:10:24.958
don't worry.

02:10:26.041 --> 02:10:28.541
-I will explain everything.
-Let's go, dear.

02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:30.708
Are you listening to me?

02:10:44.458 --> 02:10:45.666
I told you, didn’t I?

02:10:47.208 --> 02:10:49.583
That I would dig out the truth,
no matter what.

02:10:50.875 --> 02:10:51.750
And listen...

02:10:53.250 --> 02:10:55.416
you don't have much time.

02:11:19.250 --> 02:11:21.458
Have you gone mad?

02:11:38.750 --> 02:11:39.666
Karuna...

02:11:42.958 --> 02:11:43.791
My dear...

02:11:47.541 --> 02:11:48.916
You have seen...

02:11:53.291 --> 02:11:55.791
how I have slaved for this family.

02:11:57.541 --> 02:11:58.500
For years,

02:11:59.416 --> 02:12:00.583
in this very house.

02:12:02.625 --> 02:12:06.083
But I had no right… over anything.

02:12:09.083 --> 02:12:10.041
And also…

02:12:15.250 --> 02:12:16.666
I was scared, dear

02:12:18.416 --> 02:12:19.458
I was scared.

02:12:22.666 --> 02:12:25.916
I wanted to secure my son's future.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:27.291
So that’s what I did.

02:12:30.333 --> 02:12:31.666
What else could I do?

02:12:34.458 --> 02:12:36.541
Tell me. What else could I do?

02:12:41.666 --> 02:12:43.041
Your son's future?

02:12:44.250 --> 02:12:48.125
And what about mine? Your daughter's?

02:12:54.708 --> 02:12:56.458
Don't ever forgive her, Vasudha.

02:13:00.083 --> 02:13:00.958
Vikram.

02:13:02.958 --> 02:13:04.791
-Take me home.
-Go!

02:13:07.666 --> 02:13:08.750
Wherever!

02:13:11.041 --> 02:13:11.958
Just go.

02:13:14.750 --> 02:13:15.583
Vikram!

02:13:16.708 --> 02:13:17.541
Vikram!

02:14:15.541 --> 02:14:16.500
Vikram?

02:14:17.125 --> 02:14:18.125
It's me, Mummyr.

02:15:15.541 --> 02:15:16.958
Congratulations on your wedding.

02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:24.375
This dream of yours of a happy,
wholesome family…

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:29.083
forget about it.

02:15:40.541 --> 02:15:42.541
If you had any shame at all,

02:15:43.541 --> 02:15:45.916
you would have killed yourself years ago.

02:15:49.708 --> 02:15:51.708
You wouldn’t have the insolence…

02:15:54.708 --> 02:15:57.958
to even look me in the eye.

02:16:51.083 --> 02:16:51.916
Sudha!

02:16:53.541 --> 02:16:54.375
Sudha!

02:19:22.583 --> 02:19:24.791
“Raghubeer Singh murder case relevations.”

02:19:26.833 --> 02:19:30.708
But it says here that Pramila Singh

02:19:30.791 --> 02:19:33.125
plotted to kill Thakur Raghubeer Singh.

02:19:33.666 --> 02:19:34.500
Read it thoroughly.

02:19:36.250 --> 02:19:38.291
She conspired with Munna Raja

02:19:38.791 --> 02:19:41.458
and committed suicide
out of fear of getting arrested.

02:19:41.875 --> 02:19:45.500
She is said to be involved
in the murder of the housemaid too.

02:19:46.500 --> 02:19:48.833
In the course of this case...

02:19:51.333 --> 02:19:53.375
SSP Lalji Shukla...

02:19:54.208 --> 02:19:59.500
SSP Lalji Shukla will also have to face
a special inquiry.

02:20:02.291 --> 02:20:03.208
Okay.

02:20:07.583 --> 02:20:09.666
-What are you thinking?
-Nothing.

02:20:10.750 --> 02:20:13.416
I’m not thinking, I was just thinking…

02:20:14.458 --> 02:20:15.750
what happened to the girl?

02:20:17.083 --> 02:20:19.791
Pramila Singh committed suicide
after confessing.

02:20:20.833 --> 02:20:22.583
Vasudha Singh's name was kept out.

02:20:23.125 --> 02:20:25.208
Not her, I'm talking about the other one.

02:20:28.250 --> 02:20:29.916
The one you went to meet everyday.

02:20:36.708 --> 02:20:39.791
She got her share.
She’ll start a new life somewhere else.

02:20:40.875 --> 02:20:41.708
Okay.

02:20:42.791 --> 02:20:44.000
That's good.

02:20:45.333 --> 02:20:47.708
There's nothing here for her anyway.

02:20:49.791 --> 02:20:50.625
Has she left?

02:20:51.458 --> 02:20:52.500
She's leaving today.

02:20:53.416 --> 02:20:54.291
By which train?

02:20:55.708 --> 02:20:58.666
-Chapra Express.
-Is that where you're going?

02:21:05.791 --> 02:21:06.625
Yes.

02:22:39.750 --> 02:22:41.333
I got off to get water.

02:22:51.833 --> 02:22:53.375
It’s a cruel world out there.

02:22:54.375 --> 02:22:55.958
I can’t do it alone..
