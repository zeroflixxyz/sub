00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.800
Target was a softball game.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.700
The killers wore Saudi
police uniforms. Special...

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.100
Special Agent Fran Manner
was killed.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.200
(GASPING)

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.600
(CRYING)

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.300
(CLEARS THROAT)

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.400
Grant? Take a stab
at the bomb sizes.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.500
(CLEARING THROAT)

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:53.500
From the craters it looks like they used
a high explosive, possibly military grade.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.700
Twenty, thirty pounds
of P.E.T.N.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.300
That's something
that they have.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.700
Semtex or C-4
if they could get it.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.100
That there. God knows.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:07.800
That crater looks like a plane
dropped a 500-pounder.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.700
Sir? I, already know the answer to this,
but is there any chance in hell

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.600
we get to go over there
and use our hands?

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.100
If you already know the answer,
why ask the question?

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.300
Just thought I'd ask.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.400
SYKES: Look, we're not seeing
this kind of planning and execution

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.900
anywhere else, are we?
No.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.300
I mean, these ain't hot-wired
artillery shells

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.500
waiting for Humvees
to roll by.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.600
These hits are coordinated.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.500
The planning, timing in big,
broad-daylight, balls-out ugly.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.700
So fucking greedy.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.100
Do we know if they used the uniforms
in the other two attacks?

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.300
No, as far as I know
this is the first time for that.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.600
Then you're saying now they got
access to Saudi uniforms?

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.800
SYKES: I mean, baby Jesus!

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.100
Is anybody taking credit?
Anybody seen anything on the web?

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.700
Haven't heard anything.
Tom, you got anything?

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.800
We haven't found anything yet.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.700
How do we know
it's not Saudi on Saudi?

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.600
Could be. If it's Saudi, then it's
quite probably the work of Abu Hamza.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.600
Osama wannabe.
Lived in Iraq. Afghanistan.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.300
Sir, not to beat a dead horse,

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.600
but if there was ever a time for us
to put boots on Saudi sand,

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.000
I mean,
don't you think this is it?

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.100
There's no way, Adam.
They will never allow it.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.500
Then let's just ask.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.400
The Saudi Royal Family cannot appear
as if they're losing control.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.100
If they lose control of their country,
lose control of the people,

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.100
they risk losing
control of the oil.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.200
And that is not gonna happen.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.200
State Department.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.900
"We are in agreement
with the Saudi security assessment

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.800
"that any additional American presence
on kingdom soil represents reckless risk."

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.600
AGENT: Oh, come on, risk?
FLEURY: Yeah.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.200
What's that?
That's not a reckless risk?

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:30.300
Fuck it.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.800
You hang tight.
I'm gonna go get access.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.300
Keep your bags packed.
Keep your phones on.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.900
Some of you are gonna
get some calls.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:44.000
General Security Building,
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.200
Sergeant Haytham

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.400
No falsehoods

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.700
What was your involvement?

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.900
Killing those I saw responsible.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.000
So none could be questioned?

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.500
I don't understand.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.600
You were born and raised in Suweidi.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.500
Thats not a crime.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.000
Do you know Abu Hamza?

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.000
I do not.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.600
Your brother was killed fighting the Americans.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.500
True or false?

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.600
I am not my brother.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.500
Your brother was killed fighting the Americans.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:29.800
I am not my brother.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.200
He has answered the question.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.400
We found six more uniforms.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.000
...that you were assigned  in your possession.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.500
That is a crime, specially when you...

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.600
...consider the attackers wore using our uniform.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.200
I sweat.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.900
I need more uniforms
because I must change during shifts.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.400
Look at my shirts.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.300
Look.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.100
I am not interest in your sweat.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.600
(GASPING)

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.700
It's finished.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.000
Sergeant Haytham...

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.000
...you were injured when you used your vehicle...

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.200
...to protect your country.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.000
Do you understand?

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.700
Colonel Al Ghazy...

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.200
...it appears you have problems within your department.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.500
It seems we all have problems.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.300
Everyone's terrified,
so nothing moves.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.400
You and your team
aren't going anywhere

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.900
and this meeting's
just a circle jerk, Ronnie.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Attorney General Young is
gonna go through the motions

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.300
because protocol says
we get an appeal.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.700
We'll be on record,
but you expect nothing more.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.300
I met with Prince Thamer
at Saudi Embassy

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.700
15 minutes after hearing
this morning's news.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.800
And after speaking
with Thamer,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.800
I advised withholding
additional U.S. Personnel,

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.500
because a large part
of the religious justification

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:34.600
for these bombs is the presence
of current U.S. Personnel.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.600
More boots on Saudi soil

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.400
is only gonna make
an already combustible situation

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.000
that much more so.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.400
CANAVESIO: My two cents.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.200
The Saudis have not asked for F.B.I. Help.
They've done the opposite.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.800
This is just going to further complicate
an already deteriorating situation

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.700
with one of our few remaining
allies in the Middle East.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:51.800
Rock solid logic.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.000
Well, we would like to be on the record
as saying the F.B.I. Would like

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.300
an Evidence Response Team
on the ground in Riyadh now.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Doesn't your team in that country
represent exactly the kind

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.100
of target that these masters
would die for?

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.400
They'd trade 10 of their own
for one of you.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.700
Not to go after criminals
because they might try to harm you

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.800
is really not
a policy of the F.B.I.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.600
See, we try not to say uncle.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.200
We try.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.700
Let me put it to you
another way.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.000
Al Qaeda lost the first phase
of this war.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.200
And they know it.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.500
So a new zero-sum phase
has begun.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.600
"If you're a Westerner
or a moderate Arab

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:32.400
"and you won't join us, we will let loose
the truly talented murderers."

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.200
Men like Abu Hamza.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.900
These are
operational commanders

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.600
who plan, organize, train, brainwash,
preach extreme violence.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.500
These are the men
we're fighting.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:44.800
Duly noted.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.800
YOUNG: Anything else?

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.300
Now, as far as
the public's concerned

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.100
let's try to view this
through F.B.I. Agents' eyes.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.200
Is that clear?

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.900
Sir, how do you suppose this is viewed
through F.B.I. Agents' eyes?

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.400
Pardon me?

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:10.300
I said, in this situation,
how do you feel this is viewed

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.100
through our eyes?

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.700
It's a variation of vengeance.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.500
When one of your own is killed,
agents lose their analytical skills.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.800
Kind of like a...

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.400
Thirty-six hours.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.700
We don't do it in 36 hours,
we can forget it.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.800
Agent Fleury, Agent Mayes,

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.800
I appreciate your passion.
Quite spirited.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.300
If you were running the F.B.I.,
you might turn it into Patton's Third Army.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.300
Might be a good idea,
I don't know.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.700
My daddy used to fly a helicopter
up in Saudi Arabia.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.500
Is that right?
Now, where would he sit?

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.500
Would he sit either here,
or would he sit over there?

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.500
No, he used to sit
right here.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.800
And you want to know a secret?

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.100
What?

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.700
My daddy died in Saudi Arabia.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.300
Yeah. Your daddy died
in Saudi Arabia.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.900
You know your daddy
was my friend, right?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.400
Yeah.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.200
So that means
that now you're my friend.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.500
Yeah.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.400
So, since we're friends
you promise to take me flying

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.500
when you know
how to fly this helicopter?
Yeah.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.900
Good. Good.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.700
What sound does it make
when it takes off?

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.400
(IMITATING HELICOPTER WHIRRING)

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.400
Yeah.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.000
What about...

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.100
(IMITATING HELICOPTER WHIRRING)

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.800
Yeah, like that, huh?

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.800
That's when it's coming in.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.900
Look at me, Haytham.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.200
Look at me, Haytham.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.400
You saved lives today.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.800
I have no doubt about that.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.300
I love my country.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.800
I know.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.500
Never in my life...

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.100
...never have I thought to betray my country.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.300
Beleive me, I know.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.500
That's why I want you to use all your energy,

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.300
anger and frustation...

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.000
...as a tool to drive us to capture those criminals...

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.900
...and bring them to justice.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.400
How hard you gonna hit
the Royal Family tomorrow in your column?

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.300
I'm gonna hit them
with a fucking sledgehammer.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.500
The bombings or other things?

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:33.700
What's other
than the bombings?

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.400
I know you've been tracking
our investigation on Al-Haramain, right?

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.000
Yeah. Royal Family's donations
that end up blowing shit up.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.500
Yeah. Seat's taken.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.100
I need a favor.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.500
I don't do favors, Ronnie.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.900
Listen, Elaine, when this thing breaks
and it's gonna be real,

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.000
I'm gonna bring it
to you first.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.100
I'm listening.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.700
I need you to call Thamer
at the Embassy,

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.500
tell him that the F.B.I.
Is getting ready

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:01.700
to lay out major Saudi VIP indictments
dealing with charity financing

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.500
out of this Boston investment firm.
We're gonna freeze a lot of Saudi cash

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.400
and roll out some
hardcore embarrassment.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.400
And you tell them
I'm heading up the investigation.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.100
And I'm not the nicest
kid on the block.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.200
That's accurate.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.900
And all I need is
15 minutes tonight.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.100
Tonight?

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.300
Come on. Exclusive.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.400
I know you like exclusives.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.300
I'll see what I can do.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.000
Your Excellency,
Special Agent Ronald Fleury.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.600
Listen, can we talk inside?
Sure.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.900
There's too many people in there
that know both me and you.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.100
I would like to keep this
as discreet as possible.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.600
I know you have a busy schedule.
It's just, so many people in there.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.100
Why don't we
pull up here and talk?

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.200
<i>I had an interesting conversation
with a reporter from the Post.</i>

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.000
She exaggerates a lot of things.
Me, I consider myself a friend.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.800
A friend of Saudi Arabia.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.900
I just need a little cooperation,
that's all.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.800
What kind of cooperation?

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.300
Like clearance to land

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.400
on the Prince Sultan's
airport tomorrow.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.800
One month would be
as soon as we could.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.100
One month. This is gonna go
down one of two ways.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.200
One, the F.B.I. Has evidence that
two Royal Family wives donated

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.000
$10 million to three
Arab-American cultural centers

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.600
right outside of Boston,

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.000
and that some of that money
got to Jakarta

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.400
and these mosques, and they have
training camps right next to them.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.100
It's just weird to see
little kids playing

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.300
and then not-so-little kids
playing with guns right next door.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.100
It's just odd.
Don't you think?

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.500
You have no proof of this.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.600
How do you know?

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.600
It's gonna be big.
It's gonna be a big story.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.100
I mean, it's not just gonna be
in the metro papers.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.300
<i>It's gonna be in the Omaha Herald,
places like the Terrell Tribune.</i>

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.000
You, you ever been
to Terrell, Texas?

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.900
Good chili.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.300
What is your point?

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.100
I want in immediately.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.700
Define immediately.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.500
Right the fuck now immediately.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.100
So, what was
Fran Manner to her?

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.300
He taught her how to shoot.

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.300
She introduced him
to his wife.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.000
And he got her
into the Bureau.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.000
They celebrated her graduation
at the IHOP

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.400
until some townie called
Janet something.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.100
I don't know,
something not very nice.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.300
So the townie didn't see Fran
coming out of the head,

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:33.000
but he definitely felt
Fran's uppercut shatter his jaw.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.400
Really? And he didn't get
bounced for that?

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.200
No. No, Fleury took care of it.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:42.500
Yeah, I do know the post in Riyadh was part
of the deal Fleury cut to save Fran's career.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:46.300
Thank you. Janet, what did Fleury whisper
to you this morning?

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.400
Grant's age is a liability.

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.300
(EXCLAIMS)

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.800
FLEURY: Hey.
LEAVITT: Hello, sir.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:58.900
Thanks for volunteering.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.200
Yeah, actually I didn't.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.300
Well, thank you, anyway.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.400
LEAVITT: We're going to Riyadh?
Is that right?

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.100
SYKES: State Department said yes?
FLEURY: Nope.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.300
LEAVITT: White House?

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.800
FLEURY: Nope.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.600
We bringing security?
No.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.000
This is really gonna suck,
I think.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.200
LEAVITT: All right, well
that's very questionable.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.900
MAYES: Dog giving birth.
"Whelp."

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
W-H-E-L-P-S? Whelps?

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.200
Yeah.

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.500
Bitch giving birth.
Whelp. Next word.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.400
A dog giving birth.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.500
SYKES: Right on.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.600
Is that what you thought
it meant?

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.200
I know what it means.

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.300
That's why I played it.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.600
And you didn't think it was
a hit and a scream.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.800
Like a "welt" and a "yelp"?

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.100
Yeah.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.100
I don't have much here,
don't worry about it.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.500
Hey, what are four people
supposed to do

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.100
over there in five days,
anyway?

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.700
Aren't you the one that practically
demanded we go this morning?

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.800
I didn't say "I."
I said "F.B.I."

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:48.900
Let's go.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:49.900
LEAVITT: I got it, I got it!

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.300
Here it comes.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:53.600
False alarm.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.200
What's it like over there
on the ground?

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.700
It's a bit like Mars.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.100
Mars?
Yeah.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.400
Sounds like
I didn't pack right.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:08.000
Well, I will be looked at with disdain
for pretty much the entire time

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.700
we're on the ground.
Kind of like South Virginia.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.100
Hey. Go easy on my kin.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.400
(CHUCKLES)

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.300
Four FBI will be allowed to land at...

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.700
...Prince Sultan Air Base this evening.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000
General Abdulmalik,

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.000
Chief of Investigative Services for the National Gard,

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.900
has been put in charge of solving this crime.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.800
Your Highnesss.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.100
I know General Abdulmalik.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:50.900
I attend his...

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.900
...interrogation of one of my men.

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.400
The General does not have investigative experience.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.800
The attackers wore polive uniforms.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.200
Your uniforms.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.300
Some of your men may have been...

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.600
...involved with this cell.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:04.800
May still be involved.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:07.900
Al Ghazy...

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.700
...consider yourself lucky even to have a role at all.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.800
The Americans are our guest for five days.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.600
Take extremely good care of them...

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.700
...and I want them to leave as safe as they arrived.
Understood?

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.100
Yes, Your Highness.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.600
Meeting is finished.

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:53.000
Man, it feels like you got
a beast in there, Fleury.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.300
What is it?
You don't think I'm okay?

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.600
I think you're not
entirely clear right now.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.200
(SIGHS)

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.300
Look, you want to go?
We go. I got you.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.700
But you got to check yourself.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.600
I'm checked.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.900
Okay. I'm just checking
that you're checked.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:30.200
You know, I got 15 ties
in my closet from Fran.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.300
Every Christmas,
he'd give me these ties.
My God.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.000
Fran sent you ties?
He sent me ties, too.
Ties, yeah. Really?

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.900
At least 12, 13 of them.

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.200
Some of the ugliest ties
I've ever seen in...

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.200
Hey, good-looking ties.
What?

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.700
Very colorful.
I go fishing with those ties.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:49.100
I'll take you shopping with me sometime.
I'll show you style.

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:50.500
You'll show me style?

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.000
You gotta get
your L.L. Bean on.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.900
You got to? You probably buy your car
batteries and your shirts in the same place.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:56.600
(CHUCKLES)

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.700
That's good. That's good.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.200
Operation AL RAHMAH compound...

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.600
...was a blessed invasion...

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.300
...and a great Jihad.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.300
This is only the beginning.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.200
If God is willing, we shall kick out...

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.200
...all infidels from all Muslim lands.

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:23.200
God bless you, my sons.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.300
Alah will give us victory.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.400
God is great.

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:36.000
Peace be upon you all. Glory to Alah.

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:03.700
Colonel Al Ghazi.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.100
Special Agent Ronald Fleury.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:09.000
Special Agent Mayes. Special Agent Sykes.
Special Agent Leavitt.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.000
You have your vests?
Excuse me?

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.300
Vests. You know, stop bullets.
The vests.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.500
Bullet-proof vests.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.500
Yeah, we, we brought them.
We're good, thanks.

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.600
Good. I will ask for
your passports and weapons.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.400
Sykes.

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:32.900
What?

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Fuck.

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.000
There is a Israeli stamp on the passport.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.800
There is an Israeli stamp in here.
Is that a problem?

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:43.900
Israeli stamp?

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.800
LEAVITT: I've been to Israel
three times.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.600
Got a grandma there.
Is that all right?

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.100
It's not our concern.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.400
It's okay.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:03.100
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Your two fallen comrades.

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.400
If you please go
to the second vehicle.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.000
It's like 150 miles an hour.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.400
You, like, doing
like a breathing thing?

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.600
Like a yoga technique
or something?

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.100
Do you have a problem with this?
Take the iPod.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.100
Yeah, I have a problem.
I wish that I was as calm as you are.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.000
I like it.
If somebody was tailing us,

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.300
they'd stick out.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.300
Standard operation speed.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.500
Hey, explain to the driver
I get carsick.

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.000
You've got to shut up.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.000
You ever been
to the U.S., Colonel?

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
Yeah, I have been there once.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.900
I spent four days in Quantico.

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:01.700
I also saw Michael Jordan play
for the Washington Wizards.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.300
Hey, Colonel, your people got
portable lights on the scene?

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:05.500
AL GHAZl: Portable lights?

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:06.800
SYKES: So we can
work at night.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:07.900
See what we're doing.
Lights, yes.

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.000
We have portable lights.
But your team cannot work at night.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.600
Why? We only got seven days.
We work around the clock.

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.200
Five, Mister. You have five days,
and you're not safe at night.

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.500
We're safe
during the day, huh?

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:22.300
Listen, were the uniformed bombers
brother soldiers?

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.000
AL GHAZl: I don't know.

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.300
Driver, are we late or something?
Is there a...

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:28.900
Abu Hamza.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.600
You think he was responsible
for these attacks?

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:39.600

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:16.600
You know what?

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.300
That's... Whoa, whoa.

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:20.300
They're the ones
that attacked us.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:21.800
We don't know that just yet.

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:23.200
That's what I'm here for.

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:26.000
I just need to ask the boys
some questions about maybe something

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.400
that they saw the other night.

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.200
What do you want to ask my boys
about the other night?

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.100
I told you...

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.200
What do you want
to ask them about?

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:34.400
You want to ask them about
watching their mother bleed to death?

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.900
Is that what you want
to ask my boys?

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:41.000
JACKSON: My 5-year-old boy,
when I got home, had a box of Band-Aids

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.300
and he was trying to put
his mama's mouth back on.

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:52.000
Is this what Mohammed
the prophet...

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:53.400
Oh, come on, man,
let's not have a fight.

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:55.200
Is this what Allah wants?
You know that, this isn't...

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.600
This isn't gonna bring
your wife back.

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.800
Does Allah love your kids
more than he does mine?

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.700
Does Allah love your wife
more than he does mine?

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.200
Leave me the fuck alone
and do not come back to my house!

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:05.900
I'll leave you alone,
but just...

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:07.700
I should have went home
a long goddamn time ago!

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:20.400
AL GHAZl:
This is the big explosion.

00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:24.900
About one hour
into the rescue.

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:49.600
LEAVITT: Where did
the water come from?

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:51.100
They hit a water main?

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.200
AL GHAZl: Water main?

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.400
Yeah, where'd the water
come from?

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.100
From a water pipe?
They break one?

00:45:55.100 --> 00:46:00.500
No, it's from the tanks
of this fire engine.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
This is the water that didn't,
how you say it, evaporate in the blast.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.900
This truck used to be here?

00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:09.400
We think so.

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:14.100
This hole is the case.
Your men are contaminating this.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.400
You understand evidence?
Little things that are clues.

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:22.100
Clues can be very helpful
to a fellow trying to solve a crime.

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.500
You want to go into the hole?

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:25.800
Yeah! Absolutely.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.200
No.

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.700
All right.

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:34.200
Who was running security?

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:37.300
Security here is
a combination of police

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.800
and National Guards of...

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.600
Mr. Sykes! Please come back.

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:55.600
Please.

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:07.800
AL GHAZl: This vehicle was stolen.

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:12.000
A team outside the blast radius,
shooting at anything, everyone.

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.800
Sergeant Haytham ended this part.

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.800
Were any of the shooters your men?
Real Saudi police?

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.300
No, they weren't.

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:36.700
Nice work.

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:42.400
There were two officers in the car.
Both of them were executed.

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:49.800
And those were your men.
I'm sorry.

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:55.100
Car was parked here,
backed in?

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.300
Yes.

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:57.600
They were attacked
from the front,

00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.600
so they must have assumed
they were fellow officers.

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:00.800
These guys been
identified yet?

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:04.200
Not yet. It's likely that the four men
prayed in the same mosque.

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:05.800
That's enough to identify them?

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000
If it's in Suweidi, yes.

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:08.100
LEAVITT: Suweidi?

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:10.100
MAYES: Suweidi's a known
militant stronghold.

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:11.700
Al Qaeda could recruit
from the storefronts.

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:13.800
Is there any way we can check out
those surrounding buildings.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.700
Like especially
that one right there.

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.400
AL GHAZl: Why?
From the posting
on the Internet

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.400
the attack was filmed
from a high vantage point

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.200
and that building right there
looks over the whole crime scene.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.800
It's outside the walls.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.200
Come on now,
this is damn insane.

00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:27.600
We got enough security to
invade North Korea and Suweidi...

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.600
You don't know
what you are talking about.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:31.100
Can we just ask?

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:35.100
Okay.

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.400
All right. We'll be
in the Community Center.

00:48:55.600 --> 00:49:01.000
LEAVITT: How many virgins
will be available to you upon entry

00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:07.600
into the afterlife here, if you follow
what the zealots follow in this stuff?

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:09.500
Seventy.

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:12.200
That's incorrect.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:49.900
Peace be upon you, Father.

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.400
Peace be upon you and mercy of Allah.

00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:55.600
How are you, Father?

00:49:55.700 --> 00:50:00.300
Blessing from Allah. I am good. I slept awhile.

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.900
FLEURY: Hey, buddy,
how you doing?

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:40.700
I'm in Saudi Arabia.

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:42.700
Yeah, you remember
where I showed you on the map?

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:47.600
Well, right now I'm sitting
in the gym-slash-hotel.

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:48.800
(CHUCKLES)

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:54.700
What? Yeah, Fran is,
Fran's around.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.700
We, we... Yeah, I saw him.

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:03.100
He is...
He's, he's tall as ever.

00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:07.700
Yeah, and
we're looking for the bad guy.

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:11.600
And I'm gonna get some sleep.
Yeah, I'm gonna go to bed.

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:14.000
I love you, too.
All right, bye.

00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:39.200
We have permission.

00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:40.500
Really?

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:41.700
Yeah.

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:54.400
(SIRENS WAILING)

00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:27.300
FLEURY: There's the building.
That's the rooftop.
Yeah.

00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:34.400
We have a problem.

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.700
What's the problem?

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.800
This is prohibited.

00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:49.200
Whats is prohibited? We have five minutes
from General Abdulmalik.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.600
They must stay in the vehicles.

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:55.100
That is not true.

00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:57.900
They must stay in the vehicles.

00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:01.300
Call General Abdulmalik.
He will tell you we have five minutes.

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:02.600
Hey! Hey! Hey!

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:06.000
All right, easy, easy, easy.
Fleury, stop Fleury. Careful. Leave it!

00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:13.200
FLEURY: Fuck!
Al Ghazi!

00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:15.900
Tell me he didn't
blow out my eardrum.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000
Is it fucking bleeding?

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.400
It's all right.
There's no blood.

00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:20.100
Who fired?

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:21.700
Who fired?

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.400
You, come down!

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:27.200
Come on, you okay? Let's get up.
Janet, you okay? Let's get up.

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:32.300
Didn't you give us five minutes?

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:34.100
You've got five minutes.

00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:35.900
Are you okay?
Come on, Janet.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.700
Are you okay?
No, are you okay?
He slapped you.

00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:38.800
I'm good. I'm good. Thanks.

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:40.000
You sure? Let me look at you.

00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:41.000
Okay. Thank you.

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.700
All right.
Come on, let's go up.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.000
(GRUNTS)

00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:53.500
LEAVITT:
Fleury, look at this.

00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:57.000
There's the front gate,
the police car and the bomb site.

00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.600
And look.
That's about the same angle, right?

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:04.000
Yeah. Al Ghazi, have you seen
the video on Al Saha?

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:07.200
Look. Look right through there.
Same exact thing.

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:10.300
This is too pretty of a plan
to be hatched in just one day.

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:12.700
He had to come here
a couple of times.

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:15.100
This man is a Saudi.

00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:18.300
See, if foreigners were here,

00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:20.500
someone would say something.

00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:22.900
So maybe Abu Hamza?
Could be.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.800
Yeah. Then we should ask around.
Get out of here and some people...

00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:26.500
They won't tell you anything.

00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:27.700
Why not?

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:29.200
He's like Robin Hood to you.

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:32.400
People feel
sympathy to him.

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.800
FLEURY:
Well, we know two things.

00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:35.900
We know he was Saudi,
we know he was here.

00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:37.600
That's two big answers
in two minutes.

00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:39.200
Imagine if we had
a couple of days.

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:41.300
General Malik, he's got
his heart in the right place,

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:43.800
but he is clearly
not an investigator.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.300
Now listen.
Let me help you.

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.200
AL GHAZl:
It's a detonator. Where you...

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:51.600
Yeah, it's a gift
from us to you.

00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:54.300
We found it at the bomb site.
Run with that.

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:57.800
Leavitt!
Yeah?

00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:00.500
Hey, where,
where are you going?

00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:02.800
You got a lot of evidence here.
We'd like to bag it.

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:04.100
No, no we have five minutes...

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:06.100
Fucking bullshit.
We're here to collect evidence.

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:07.500
Why you say this bad word?

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:09.000
We're not fucking
tourists here, all right.

00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:10.300
Why you say these bad words?

00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:11.700
I'm getting the kit.
Fleury, talk to this guy.

00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:14.800
I would bring a soap
and wash your mouth!
What do you think?

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.100
(CHUCKLES)

00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.500
Leavitt!

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:20.500
LEAVITT: Yeah, it's Leavitt,
not Livette.

00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:23.100
I'm not a goddamn
French-Canadian.

00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:28.900
Tonight we have the dinner
in the palace.

00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:33.800
Miss Mayes,
she can't be there.

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.500
It's only men.
Only men?

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.100
Yeah, you know, tradition.

00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:40.000
That's gonna be boring.
No women?

00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:41.100
No. Just men.

00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:42.500
No women allowed. All right.

00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:43.900
Only men.
Yeah.

00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:45.400
You wait.
No.

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:48.200
Janet. He wants to
tell you something.

00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:53.900
What?

00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:55.700
How's your ear? It is good?

00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:58.700
It's the right one
or the left?

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.500
How many princes are there?

00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:22.800
AL GHAZl: Over 5,000.

00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:24.400
Does every prince get
a palace this big?

00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:26.000
Some get bigger.

00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:27.500
LEAVITT: And who pays
for all this?

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:29.800
SYKES: Exxon? Chevron? Shell?

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:33.600
AL GHAZl: Serious now, the Prince will
talk to you like subjects.

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:36.700
If he gives you to hold
his raptor, do not flinch.

00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:38.200
It is a compliment.

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:40.000
LEAVITT: His what?
Hold his rapture?

00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:45.300
His talons slice bones.

00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:47.200
That right?

00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:50.000
That's my most prolific hunter.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.900
I try to teach his friend
over there,

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.400
but I fear it is something
you are born with or not.

00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.800
PRINCE: You agree,
Mr. Ronald?

00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:59.100
Innate or not at all?

00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.300
I do.

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.000
PRINCE: What have you seen
so far in our kingdom?

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.300
I know that I can arrange a safari for you
and your colleagues.

00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:08.900
Safari?

00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:12.700
Well...

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:23.600
I'll tell you what I've seen.
I've seen...

00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:31.100
I've seen that the man that planned
the worst crime in your kingdom's history

00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:33.700
is without a doubt Saudi.

00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:41.700
If you walk three kilometers
from the compound,

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:45.300
you will find the rooftop
where the attacks were planned.

00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:48.600
I've seen a person in this room
who's "born with it."

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.600
Colonel Al Ghazi. Everything that
I'm telling you Mr. Al Ghazi told us

00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:56.700
while he was observing the crime scenes
and protecting us.

00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:58.300
He wasn't even on duty.

00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:01.400
So I agree with you that instincts
like this cannot be taught.

00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:04.600
Not to falcons,
and definitely not to SANG generals.

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:08.500
I know you want him caught.
We want him caught.

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:10.800
So let us help you.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.100
America's not perfect, not at all,
I'll be the first to say that,

00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:16.300
but we are good at this.

00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:21.000
Allow us to help your men
go catch this criminal.

00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:35.400
AL GHAZl: The rules
for tonight still stand,

00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:36.700
but tomorrow is a new day.

00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:37.900
SYKES: All right, Ghazi.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.000
Look at you Mr. Al Ghazi.

00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:40.900
Coming through.
You feeling your power, huh?

00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:42.800
Yeah, of course.
You feel his power?
He's real powerful.

00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:44.800
AL GHAZl: We made a success
tonight, correct or not?

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:45.900
We need to party.

00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:47.100
Okay.

00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:48.200
(MEN CHATTERING)

00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.200
(LEAVITT TRILLING)

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.700
Okay. Give him half,
you keep half.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.100
Tell him pass them out
around the compound,

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.100
see if they recognize anything.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.800
Let's go.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.800
Need a little check? Huh?

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.900
You big queer.
I can... Never mind.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.600
Gonna have to get
a little dirty, people.

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:44.200
Yeah, you got to get dirty.
Nasty, filthy!

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.500
(LAUGHING)

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:51.300
All right, fellows, what we need to do is
get this water out of here.

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:54.400
So we can see what's
really going on down here.

01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:57.100
You understand?

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:02.300
See, something drivable
blew up.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.500
Let's dry up this hole to see
if we can't figure out what she was.

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.400
All right?

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.700
Who's got a pump?

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:22.000
Pump?

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:24.100
Yeah, a pump.
Pump out the water.

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.500
You cannot touch any Muslim.

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:51.400
So tell me what to do,
I'll do it.

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.000
Yeah, come over here then.
Take this.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:57.400
This finger also? I push it?
Yes, please.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.800
Really clean on the...
That's what's important.

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:06.100
Okay. Good. The non-Muslim bodies,
where are they?

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.300
HAYTHAM: We have them
in the next tent.

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:11.500
I need to see them.

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:16.300
FLEURY: Just take a look at these and
see if you recognize any of them please.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.100
Oh, those are horrible.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.700
No, I'm sorry,
I don't recognize either of them.

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:27.400
You know, that chair outside
looks like it gets a lot of wear.

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:28.900
It looks comfortable.

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:30.800
(CHUCKLING) Yeah, it is.
That's my mom's chair.

01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:32.200
FLEURY: She spends
a lot of time out there?

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:33.500
Yeah, all day.

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:36.200
All day, huh? Where is she?

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.200
She's sleeping now.

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:40.000
Then let's wake her up.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:41.500
MADDY: I've seen him.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.600
When?

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.300
Like a week ago.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.300
Twice, I've seen him
watering with the garden crews.

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.700
And I thought that was funny.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:51.900
FLEURY: Funny how?

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.800
He was a Saudi, I'm pretty sure.
The gardener.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.800
Yeah?
Well, Saudis, like Americans

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.800
don't do manual labor.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.200
Blowing leaves is
beneath them.

01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:46.900
The gardener. We know who he is.
I want to take you somewhere.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:48.100
Where?

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:51.300
Someone who can lead us
to catch the big dogs.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:52.600
More like the big fish.

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:53.600
AL GHAZl: Big fish?

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:55.500
Yeah, big fish.

01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:02.200
A dog... A dog is more bigger
than a fish.

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:04.700
Yeah, I don't...
I didn't make it up.

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:10.800
(SYKES SINGING)

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:16.400
<i>Don't count on me
To do the things I've done before</i>

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:22.600
So why'd you get into this,
Al Ghazi?

01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:23.700
Into what?

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:26.000
Being a cop. Why'd you
get into being a cop?

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.700
I mean, with all this
violence and chaos, it seems so crazy.

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:30.800
It's because of...

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.400
The Green Beast.
The what?

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.700
The Green Beast.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.000
What the hell is
the Green Beast?

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:39.600
It's a TV show when I was kid.

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:41.600
You know,
a man who turns green

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:44.100
when he's very angry,
he turns green and...

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:45.400
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, the Hulk.

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:49.900
Yeah, you know. He was killing just
bad people, because they did wrong.

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:53.700
Yeah. Yeah, "Don't make me angry.
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry."

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:56.200
Ah, you know
also Steve Austin?

you mean?

No, no, no.

You know what those sons of bitches did?

They blew up an ambulance.

Oh, man. Now that is nasty!

Beautiful son.

And I find myself in a place
where I no longer care

01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.800
about why we are attacked.

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:30.500
I only care that 100 people
woke up a few mornings ago,

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:32.800
had no idea it was their last.

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:37.700
When we catch the man
who murdered these people,

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.500
I don't care to ask
even one question.

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:42.700
I want to kill him.

Yes, I do.

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.400
So, is your first name Colonel?

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:04.000
What?

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.500
Izz Al Din.

01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:33.200
He joined bin Laden when Al Qaeda
brought the fight to the Royal Family.

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:35.300
Does he know
where bin Laden is?
No, no, no, no, no.

01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:37.700
'Cause that'd be a real big promotion
for me, if I could get that one.

01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:41.100
He turned himself in last year
during an amnesty.

01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:45.400
He's now part of a new government effort,
to balance the experience of Saudi youth.

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:47.600
Oh, he's doing
community service.
Yes.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.800
Okay.
Yes.

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:40.000
The man who made war
on Al Rahmah is someone his age.

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:51.200
A man who can plan mass murder
of women and children

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.200
and then go home
and sleep soundly,

01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:56.400
that kind of man is
supremely difficult to catch.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.200
How does he know
he slept soundly?

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.800
Because he hasn't stopped.

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:13.500
You stop only when dead faces
don't let you sleep.

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:15.000
Is that why you quit?

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:25.500
Seventeen days without sleep
will make you quit anything.

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.300
American military detonator.

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:38.500
Yeah.

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:41.000
How would they get it?

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:51.700
There are several ways to get
this military equipment.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.600
But not everyone can get it.

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.100
Could Abu Hamza get 'em?

01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:09.200
Absolutely, yes.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.400
Then ask him if he knows
where I can find Abu Hamza.

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:18.200
Did you say something funny?
'Cause I didn't say something funny.

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:21.000
Abu Hamza, he is like ghost.

01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:23.100
Abu Hamza like a ghost.

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:24.200
Yeah, I got that.

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:26.500
I understood that.

01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:30.200
You need...

01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:31.800
Yeah, prayers, luck and...

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.300
Handshakes.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:45.600
Every bomb maker at some point
gets bitten by his own work.

01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:12.100
Okay, chief.

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:21.100
HAYTHAM:
It's hospital identification.

01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:23.000
SYKES: You know it?
Yes.

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:24.700
Call it in.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.700
LEAVITT: Look who got
the big clue!

01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:28.900
It's some pretty soft skin,
I'll bet you, too.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.300
You know,
that mud looked pretty good.

01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.800
Hey, hey, come on,
that's my only shirt, Grant!

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:39.400
The ambulance was stolen
from King Fahd Hospital,

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:40.600
three days before the bombing.

01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:41.600
Okay.

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:46.200
I got 20 men that rotated shifts
on the stolen ambulance.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:50.200
One of them is very important.
He's in our interest.

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:54.200
His name is Muaath Al Abdullah.
This is Fahd Al Abdullah, his brother.

Put that gun down.

01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:56.500
Put it down!
Put that fucking gun down!

01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:58.700
Put the fucking gun down right now!
Put the gun down!

01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:01.100
(WOMEN SCREAM)

01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:02.300
Ali.

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:03.700
Fuck.

01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:05.700
(SHOUTING)

01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:12.200
Go, go, go, go.

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:16.200
Hold on. Fuck.
Hold on, buddy. Hold on.

01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:19.300
Hold on. Hold on.
Breathe, breathe, breathe, fucking breathe.

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:22.900
It's okay. God, he's just a kid.
He's just a kid.

01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:30.100
It's all right, I got you, I got you,
I got you, I got you. I got you.

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:33.600
I got you. Just calm down. Relax.
Relax, relax. Gotta breathe.

01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:37.000
You gotta breathe, you gotta breathe.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:40.600
Relax, relax. You gotta breathe.
You gotta breathe.

01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:45.800
Let's get a fucking ambulance!

01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:58.300
We got 'em. We got 'em. We got 'em.
We got 'em, okay? We got 'em all.

01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:00.500
Just relax. Relax, baby.

01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:02.200
Come on,
you gotta stay with us.

01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:04.300
You gotta stay with us.
You gotta...

01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:06.900
Faris! Faris!

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:31.800
Yeah. We got 'em, baby.
We got 'em.

01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:37.800
My condolences.
Thank you.

01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:23.200
HAYTHAM:
This is his son, Sultan.

01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:24.900
Sultan. Hey.

01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:33.300
Tell him that his father
was a very brave man.

01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:46.400
He asks if you know his father.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.300
Yeah.

01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:57.200
I knew your father,
your father was a good friend of mine.

01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:08.800
All right.

01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:53.300
Thank you, Sergeant Haytham.

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:54.700
Thank you.

01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:58.400
Thank you, man.

01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:00.800
This is to keep away
your worries.

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:06.900
Thanks, man.

01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:34.800
We testify next Tuesday.

01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:36.900
Fleury goes first.
But I'm gonna go through it

01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:39.400
with each of you one-on-one,
in advance, just to make sure

01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:41.500
we're all on the same page.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.500
If they ask you, if we've talked about
any of this, the answer is

01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:47.500
unequivocally no, okay?

01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:53.000
You did outstanding work over there.
You hold your heads high.

01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:05.000
Fleury.

01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:09.300
Tell me what you whispered to Janet,
in the briefing, to get her to stop crying

01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:12.300
about Fran, you know,
before all this, before we even got airborne.

01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:14.500
What'd you say to her?

01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:24.800
Tell me, whst did your grandfather whisper in
your ear before he died?

01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:27.200
You remember?

01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:37.500
I told her we were
gonna kill them all.

01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:43.500
Don't fear them, my child. We are going to
kill them all.
