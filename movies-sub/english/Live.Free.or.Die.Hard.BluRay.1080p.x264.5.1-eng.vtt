Get ready to run.

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:19.585
What the―

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:24.590
What the hell was that?!

00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:26.592
- What?
- Did you do that?

00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:28.885
No.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.555
- Shit.

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:32.681
Shit.

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:34.891
Stay close.

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:36.518
The whole apartment's on fire.

00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:38.604
Come on.

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:39.813
Let's go.

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:43.692
Come on.

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:47.279
Watch it.
Just hold it down.

00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:49.364
Oh, my God.

00:15:50.617 --> 00:15:51.950
Hey.

00:15:52.035 --> 00:15:53.785
- Come on.
- Okay.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.912
Come on. Come on.

00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:57.372
Stay close.

00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:12.220
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

00:16:14.349 --> 00:16:16.141
- Come on, let's go. Stay close.
- Okay.

00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:20.312
Get in the car.

00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:21.855
Go, go. Now.

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:29.488
Can you reload a gun?

00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:31.657
- Uh, me? Uh, yeah.
- Can you reload a gun?!

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:35.619
Open the glove box
and get a magazine

00:16:35.703 --> 00:16:37.329
out ofthe thing right now!

00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:42.959
Grab the gun

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:44.086
on the backseat!

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:47.005
Quick!

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:15.283
Get your head down!

00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:21.456
Jesus!
Is the circus in town?

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:29.673
Whoo!

00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:32.718
Did you see that?

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:34.052
Yeah, I saw it.
I did it.

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:38.682
Camden Base,
one double-oh-seven-seven.

00:17:38.766 --> 00:17:39.808
Come back, Camden Base.

00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:41.393
One-double-oh-seven-seven.

00:17:41.477 --> 00:17:42.853
DISPATCH:

a police shooting

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:18.263
Yeah.

00:18:18.347 --> 00:18:20.056
WOMAN:
What's the status?

00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:27.147
Wait one.

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:50.796
Thomas. We had a problem
in NewJersey.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.214
Farrell's still alive.

00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:56.009
So he got away.

00:18:56.093 --> 00:18:57.594
Yeah.

00:18:57.678 --> 00:18:58.595
GABRIEL:
I did send

00:18:58.679 --> 00:18:59.846
five ofyou, is that right?

00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:03.725
I'm sending a chopper.
Just get airborne.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.560
We'll track him down.
Thinkyou can handle that?

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.317
FARRELL:
Oh, my God...

00:19:12.401 --> 00:19:14.486
McCLANE:
Just breathe.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:17.322
I am breathing.
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm...

00:19:17.406 --> 00:19:19.157
- Can't stop shaking.
- lt's the adrenaline.

00:19:19.242 --> 00:19:20.867
You'rejust scared.
It'll pass.

00:19:20.952 --> 00:19:22.202
Yeah, I'm scared.

00:19:22.286 --> 00:19:25.163
Weren't you scared back there?

00:19:25.248 --> 00:19:27.249
Yeah.

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:28.542
I was scared.

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:30.210
Really? This is you being scared?

00:19:30.294 --> 00:19:33.296
'Cause you seem really calm.

00:19:33.381 --> 00:19:35.632
Have you done stuff
like that before?

00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:37.801
Stuff like what?

00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:39.344
Like killing people.

00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:43.181
Yeah.

00:19:43.266 --> 00:19:44.599
But not for a long time.

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:47.394
So who were those guys?
Huh?

00:19:47.478 --> 00:19:48.937
Why were they trying to kill you?

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:51.189
Why did they blow up
my goddamn apartment?

00:19:51.274 --> 00:19:53.984
They were there to kill you.

00:19:54.068 --> 00:19:56.903
Why would they want to kill me?

00:19:56.988 --> 00:19:58.989
You tell me, kid.

00:19:59.073 --> 00:20:00.699
You're the criminal.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.215
I got seven
dead hackers so far,

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.718
none ofwhom were high on our list.

00:20:19.802 --> 00:20:21.720
Collect the hard drives,
start sweeping 'em.

00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:23.471
Yes, sir.

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:28.685
Trey...

00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:31.354
Matthew Farrell— find him for me.

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:33.231
On it.

00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:37.736
What's with all the guns?

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.530
Operational prudence.

00:20:40.615 --> 00:20:43.491
Think ofthem as hardware
to your software.

00:20:55.671 --> 00:20:57.797
RADIO DISCJOCKEY:
Good morning, D.C.!

00:20:57.882 --> 00:20:59.549
Well, it's shaping up
to be another beautiful

00:20:59.634 --> 00:21:01.176
Fourth ofJuly weekend.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.720
Ifyou've got any big plans,
better get started early,

00:21:03.804 --> 00:21:05.764
'cause it looks like
the traffic is ramping up.

00:21:05.848 --> 00:21:09.434
So, here's another golden oldie
for all the commuters out there.

00:21:10.561 --> 00:21:12.103
What...?!

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:14.230
What? What?

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:16.483
What are you doing?
What is that?

00:21:16.567 --> 00:21:18.610
- It's Creedence.
- Creedence?!

00:21:18.694 --> 00:21:20.362
Creedence.
Creedence Clearwater Revival.

00:21:20.446 --> 00:21:22.238
Classic rock.

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:23.573
I know who it is.

00:21:23.658 --> 00:21:26.201
lt's old rock; that
doesn't make it classic.

00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:27.994
What sucked back then
still sucks now.

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:29.245
You don't like Creedence?

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:32.040
This is like having a pinecone
shoved in my ass.

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:36.419
Okay. Really?
Wow, that's mature.

00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:38.505
FARRELL:
Come on, man. I'm cooperating with you.

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:42.968
MAN:
We're at a heading ofzero-six-zero.

00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:44.344
Making another pass.

00:21:47.598 --> 00:21:48.890
GABRIEL:
Listen up, everyone.

00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:50.475
Are we ready?

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:53.436
Transportation hubs
are prepped and set.

00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:56.398
Begin stage one.

00:22:23.592 --> 00:22:25.844
ANNOUNCER:
...with six and a half innings in game...

00:22:27.263 --> 00:22:29.180
ANNOUNCER 2:
...this weekend for two shows only...

00:22:29.265 --> 00:22:30.724
FARRELL:
When's the last time you remember

00:22:30.808 --> 00:22:32.642
turning on the radio and
listening to popular music?

00:22:32.727 --> 00:22:35.145
Just give me a decade.

00:22:35.229 --> 00:22:36.688
The '70s?

00:22:36.772 --> 00:22:38.773
I'm guessing... was
Michael Jackson still black?

00:22:38.858 --> 00:22:40.900
Pearl Jam— I'll
go back ten years

00:22:40.985 --> 00:22:42.819
with you... ten years.

00:22:42.903 --> 00:22:44.988
20 years...
The Cure? Nothing?

00:22:45.072 --> 00:22:46.364
It's called news radio.

00:22:46.449 --> 00:22:49.200
I was trying to see ifany
ofyour friends from Camden

00:22:49.285 --> 00:22:50.243
made the headlines.

00:22:50.327 --> 00:22:52.203
Hold on...
you listen to the news.

00:22:52.288 --> 00:22:53.747
You got a problem with the news now?

00:22:55.499 --> 00:22:56.750
Yeah, I got a big

00:22:56.834 --> 00:22:59.085
goddamn problem with the news.
You ready for this?

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.629
The news is completely manipulated.

00:23:01.714 --> 00:23:03.339
Everything you hear,

00:23:03.424 --> 00:23:06.092
every single day,

00:23:06.177 --> 00:23:08.011
is designed by corporate media
to do one thing,

00:23:08.095 --> 00:23:09.804
- and one thing only:
-Jesus...

00:23:09.889 --> 00:23:10.889
to keep you living in fear.

00:23:10.973 --> 00:23:12.474
Oh, fear?

00:23:12.558 --> 00:23:14.017
Total fear!
Fear so you'll go out

00:23:14.101 --> 00:23:15.185
and you'll spend money
on things—

00:23:15.269 --> 00:23:16.311
things you probably don't even need.

00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:17.771
Things you probably
already have six of

00:23:17.855 --> 00:23:19.814
so that their advertisers keep
buying ads on their stations.

00:23:19.899 --> 00:23:21.649
Tell you one more thing—
you ready for this?

00:23:21.734 --> 00:23:23.651
I'll do this all day.
I got days ofdata at home.

00:23:23.736 --> 00:23:24.569
- You don't believe me.
- Hey...

00:23:24.653 --> 00:23:25.737
I'll drop a bomb on you bigger...

00:23:25.821 --> 00:23:26.905
- Hey!
- What? What?

00:23:26.989 --> 00:23:28.031
Shut... up.

00:23:28.115 --> 00:23:29.032
That's good. That's good.

00:23:29.116 --> 00:23:30.533
Be dismissive...

00:24:23.212 --> 00:24:24.129
You all right?

00:24:24.213 --> 00:24:25.880
No, I'm not all right!

00:24:25.965 --> 00:24:28.424
Just stay in the car.
You'll be all right.

00:24:32.054 --> 00:24:34.264
Hey, man... hey.

00:24:34.348 --> 00:24:35.807
Howyou doing?
You all right?

00:24:35.891 --> 00:24:37.642
Don't move.Just call
91 1 , all right?

00:24:37.726 --> 00:24:39.102
Okay...

00:24:41.522 --> 00:24:42.647
Jesus Christ.

00:25:03.419 --> 00:25:05.378
All the lights are green.

00:25:05.462 --> 00:25:06.504
Huh?

00:25:06.589 --> 00:25:07.922
All the lights are green.
Let's go.

00:25:08.007 --> 00:25:08.923
Let's go, right now.

00:25:09.008 --> 00:25:09.966
- We gotta go?
- Let's go.

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:12.343
Get your bag, hack boy.
Let's go.

00:25:13.888 --> 00:25:15.388
-Jesus Christ.
- Let's go.

00:25:15.472 --> 00:25:17.599
- I've never been in a car accident.
- Come on. You all right? Well...

00:25:17.683 --> 00:25:19.350
Very exciting.
Here we go, this way, come on.

00:25:19.435 --> 00:25:21.519
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Ever been in a car acc...

00:25:21.604 --> 00:25:23.313
- Yeah, I've been in a car accident.
- What are we doing?

00:25:23.397 --> 00:25:25.648
It's a little thing
they invented back in the '60s

00:25:25.733 --> 00:25:27.525
called "jogging."
You're gonna love it. Come on.

00:25:36.911 --> 00:25:38.661
Sir, Chicago's reporting
a system crash

00:25:38.746 --> 00:25:40.997
on their el train network.

00:25:45.377 --> 00:25:48.046
Amtrak is flashing a level-one
crash in their comm system.

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:49.714
F.A.A.just issued a critical alert.

00:25:49.798 --> 00:25:51.466
Their A.T.C. netjust went down.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.510
We're under attack.

00:25:55.971 --> 00:25:58.848
Okay, let's get 'em outside
for a little fresh air.

00:26:09.526 --> 00:26:12.153
That's the anthrax alarm.

00:26:14.031 --> 00:26:15.823
All right, everyone out, now!

00:26:15.908 --> 00:26:17.158
Now!

00:26:19.703 --> 00:26:22.705
Taylor, move, go! Move!

00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:40.431
All personnel must evacuate and proceed

00:26:40.516 --> 00:26:42.892
to the transportation shuttles
immediately.

00:26:42.977 --> 00:26:44.936
This is not a drill.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.647
All personnel must evacuate
and proceed

00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:51.025
to the transportation shuttles
immediately.

00:27:04.498 --> 00:27:07.208
No, I'm telling you,
protocol says...

00:27:10.462 --> 00:27:11.838
We need you inside.

00:27:17.886 --> 00:27:21.472
Take the team. l want men on the
fourth floor, got it? Masks on.

00:27:24.893 --> 00:27:26.185
Got to know what's there, okay?

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.229
Why don't you run a search
on these data crashes?

00:27:28.314 --> 00:27:30.064
See ifwe can I.D.
the point oforigin.

00:27:32.318 --> 00:27:35.069
Begin stage two.

00:27:41.452 --> 00:27:42.827
- Hey, what's going on?
- Whoa!

00:27:42.911 --> 00:27:44.287
- Hey, what's going on?!
- No!

00:27:50.419 --> 00:27:52.420
They're already starting to panic.

00:27:56.175 --> 00:27:58.176
Ofcourse they are.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.803
They think that someone's
taking their money.

00:28:00.888 --> 00:28:04.057
All those nickels and dimes
they saved have meaning.

00:28:04.141 --> 00:28:07.226
Useful idiots, as Lenin would say.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.688
Prep the video package.

00:28:23.911 --> 00:28:25.578
D.C. transportation
system's crashing,

00:28:25.662 --> 00:28:27.330
and theyjust hit
the entire financial sector―

00:28:27.414 --> 00:28:28.790
everything, all of it.

00:28:28.874 --> 00:28:30.541
Get me the Secretary
ofTrans and Treasury

00:28:30.626 --> 00:28:33.044
on the line and the chairman
for the S.E.C.

00:28:33.128 --> 00:28:34.295
Let's go, people!

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.672
Somewhere, somebody
left a digital fingerprint.

00:28:36.757 --> 00:28:37.840
Find it!

00:28:37.925 --> 00:28:39.634
Is Deputy Director Bowman in here?

00:28:39.718 --> 00:28:41.803
Not now. It'll have to wait.

00:28:41.887 --> 00:28:42.762
Not today, waxworks.

00:28:42.846 --> 00:28:44.138
This is Matthew Farrell.

00:28:44.223 --> 00:28:46.015
I brought him here
on direct orders from Bowman.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.184
So ifyou don't know
what the hell's going on,

00:28:48.268 --> 00:28:49.227
go find me somebody that does.

00:28:49.311 --> 00:28:50.478
I'm Bowman.

00:28:55.943 --> 00:28:57.985
Video package is ready for upload.

00:29:01.657 --> 00:29:03.032
Thanks.

00:29:03.117 --> 00:29:05.034
BOWMAN:
Listen,John, appreciate you bringing Farrell here,

00:29:05.119 --> 00:29:06.244
but everything's changed
this morning.

00:29:06.328 --> 00:29:07.662
We are neck-deep in damage control.

00:29:07.746 --> 00:29:09.705
Excuse me. I'm sorry, sir.

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:10.832
Do you have
anything, uh,

00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:12.625
to eat, any kind ofsnacks around?

00:29:12.709 --> 00:29:14.293
I would love, um...
really low blood sugar,

00:29:14.378 --> 00:29:15.837
- and...
- Sir.

00:29:15.921 --> 00:29:17.338
No?

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.009
TV REPORTER:
As ifthe nationwide

00:29:22.094 --> 00:29:24.345
transportation breakdown
and anthrax scares

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:25.930
weren't enough for one day,

00:29:26.014 --> 00:29:29.142
the stock market found itself in
a selling frenzy this afternoon.

00:29:29.226 --> 00:29:31.352
The Federal Trade Commission
believes this panic

00:29:31.437 --> 00:29:33.229
might have been triggered
by a computer malfunction

00:29:33.313 --> 00:29:34.355
in the stock exchange.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.565
What were thought to be
unrelated events...

00:29:35.649 --> 00:29:37.483
Oh, man, that is all bad.

00:29:37.568 --> 00:29:38.776
REPORTER:
...a terrorist attack.

00:29:38.861 --> 00:29:40.069
Not as bad as it looks.

00:29:40.154 --> 00:29:42.029
We run drills to prepare
for things like this.

00:29:44.324 --> 00:29:45.783
- These your suspects?
- Were.

00:29:45.868 --> 00:29:47.034
All seven were killed

00:29:47.119 --> 00:29:48.536
in the last 24 hours.

00:29:49.955 --> 00:29:52.081
Recognize any ofthese people?

00:29:54.001 --> 00:29:55.793
No.

00:29:55.878 --> 00:29:57.253
Not one?

00:29:57.337 --> 00:29:58.296
WOMAN:
Sir.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.590
Got a system error.

00:30:12.227 --> 00:30:13.686
My fellow Americans...

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:14.687
It is time to...

00:30:14.771 --> 00:30:15.730
- strike
- fear

00:30:15.814 --> 00:30:17.899
- into
- the hearts ofcitizenry.

00:30:19.067 --> 00:30:21.861
- Ask not...
- It's an unauthorized broadcast.

00:30:21.945 --> 00:30:23.488
- ...what your country can do
- to avert

00:30:23.572 --> 00:30:24.489
- this
- crisis.

00:30:24.573 --> 00:30:27.366
- The answer is
- nothing whatsoever.

00:30:27.451 --> 00:30:28.910
- Our military
- strength

00:30:28.994 --> 00:30:31.078
-is -in -this -case

00:30:31.163 --> 00:30:32.330
...useless.

00:30:32.414 --> 00:30:35.958
GEORGE H.W. BUSH:
Read my lips:

00:30:36.043 --> 00:30:38.127
-the -great -confident

00:30:38.212 --> 00:30:39.128

00:30:42.841 --> 00:30:44.217
an end.

00:30:44.301 --> 00:30:45.968
-All the -vital

00:30:46.053 --> 00:30:48.012
-that -this -nation

00:30:48.096 --> 00:30:49.222

- all communications

00:30:51.141 --> 00:30:52.683
- the Internet

00:30:52.768 --> 00:30:54.310
- electrical

00:30:54.394 --> 00:30:55.770

00:30:55.854 --> 00:30:57.605

-in -our -hands

00:31:01.193 --> 00:31:02.360
We will not tire.

00:31:02.444 --> 00:31:04.862
We will not falter.

00:31:04.947 --> 00:31:06.197
And we will not fail.

00:31:06.281 --> 00:31:07.990
I don't know how they're getting in.

00:31:09.159 --> 00:31:09.992
Thankyou.

00:31:10.077 --> 00:31:10.993
-And a -happy

00:31:11.078 --> 00:31:12.828
- Independence Day
- to everyone.

00:31:16.583 --> 00:31:18.626
That was creepy.

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:20.378
I tried to find more Nixon.

00:31:20.462 --> 00:31:23.172
Think they bought it?

00:31:23.257 --> 00:31:25.258
Absolutely.

00:31:27.803 --> 00:31:31.180
Okay, I want telecom,
transportation, any and every...

00:31:31.265 --> 00:31:32.974
Jesus Christ, it's a fire sale.

00:31:33.058 --> 00:31:34.016
What?

00:31:34.101 --> 00:31:36.769
It's a fire sale.

00:31:36.853 --> 00:31:38.020
Hey!

00:31:38.105 --> 00:31:39.230
We don't know that yet.

00:31:39.314 --> 00:31:40.690
Yeah, it's a myth, anyway.
Can't be done.

00:31:40.774 --> 00:31:42.275
Oh, it's a myth? Really?

00:31:42.359 --> 00:31:44.610
Please tell me she's only here
for show and she's actually not

00:31:44.695 --> 00:31:46.404
- in charge ofanything.
- What's a fire sale?

00:31:46.488 --> 00:31:49.115
It's a three-step...
it's a three-step

00:31:49.199 --> 00:31:51.075
systematic attack on the entire
national infrastructure.

00:31:51.159 --> 00:31:52.910
Okay, step one:

00:31:52.995 --> 00:31:54.579
take out all the transportation.

00:31:54.663 --> 00:31:56.247
Step two: the financial base
and telecoms.

00:31:56.331 --> 00:31:58.124
Step three: you get rid
ofall the utilities—

00:31:58.208 --> 00:32:00.418
gas, water, electric, nuclear.

00:32:00.502 --> 00:32:02.086
Pretty much anything
that's run by computers,

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:04.380
which, which, today
is almost everything.

00:32:04.464 --> 00:32:05.548
So that's why they

00:32:05.632 --> 00:32:07.592
call it a fire sale,
because everything must go.

00:32:07.676 --> 00:32:09.135
Hey, l-listen, listen.

00:32:09.219 --> 00:32:10.595
What's your name?
Farrell?

00:32:10.679 --> 00:32:12.597
Keep your voice down, okay?

00:32:12.681 --> 00:32:14.515
No one here's talking
about a fire sale.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.476
Not unless you're telling me
you helped plan one.

00:32:19.104 --> 00:32:21.022
What? No, man, I'm just
saying... to explain...

00:32:21.106 --> 00:32:22.398
Appreciate your concern.

00:32:22.482 --> 00:32:24.275
We know what we're doing;
we're on it. Thankyou.

00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:26.527
- You've done a bang-upjob so far.
- What?

00:32:26.612 --> 00:32:27.612
- Bang...
- What?

00:32:27.696 --> 00:32:29.697
Nothing. I get...
I said I understand.

00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:31.032
Hey.

00:32:31.116 --> 00:32:33.951
They didn't send the Girl Scouts
out to get this kid.

00:32:34.036 --> 00:32:36.537
They sent professional guys,
full tactical gear.

00:32:36.622 --> 00:32:37.872
They blew the wholejoint up.

00:32:37.956 --> 00:32:39.457
Now, look, I don't know this kid.

00:32:39.541 --> 00:32:41.375
And frankly, I don't
give a shit. No offense.

00:32:42.377 --> 00:32:43.711
But somebody wants this kid dead.

00:32:44.713 --> 00:32:46.005
And obviously,
it's got something to do

00:32:46.089 --> 00:32:48.132
with whatever is going on here.

00:32:48.216 --> 00:32:49.842
Okay.

00:32:49.926 --> 00:32:52.970
Homeland's taking over the interrogation
ofthe hackers we're bringing in.

00:32:53.055 --> 00:32:54.513
I'll get you an escort over there.

00:32:54.598 --> 00:32:56.182
All right? Molina,

00:32:56.266 --> 00:32:58.142
get this kid
to the front ofthe line.

00:32:58.226 --> 00:32:59.477
I want to know what he knows.

00:32:59.561 --> 00:33:00.978
MOLINA:
Right.

00:33:01.063 --> 00:33:02.438
Ifthat guy knew
halfthe shit

00:33:02.522 --> 00:33:04.106
that I know, his fuzzy
little head would explode.

00:33:04.191 --> 00:33:07.151
Special AgentJohnson.
We'll take the sedan.

00:33:07.235 --> 00:33:08.569
AgentJohnson?

00:33:08.654 --> 00:33:09.987
That's right.

00:33:10.072 --> 00:33:11.155
Right this way.

00:33:11.239 --> 00:33:13.199
Great.

00:33:13.283 --> 00:33:15.951
So, is any ofthat actually possible,
what you were saying back there?

00:33:16.036 --> 00:33:18.204
Is it possible? Here, look,
I'm gonna tell you again.

00:33:18.288 --> 00:33:21.040
You take out any one thing,
the system can recover, right?

00:33:21.124 --> 00:33:24.168
Ifyou take it all down at once,
the system crashes and...

00:33:24.252 --> 00:33:25.544
Look around, man!

00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:27.546
Come on.
Government's got to have

00:33:27.631 --> 00:33:29.548
dozens ofdepartments
dedicated to that shit.

00:33:29.633 --> 00:33:33.511
lt took FEMA five days
to get water to the Superdome.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.453
How long till we get to D.H.S.?

00:33:59.538 --> 00:34:01.038
Laughlin.

00:34:01.123 --> 00:34:02.832
Get on the D.C. police band,

00:34:02.916 --> 00:34:05.668
and get 'em to clear
a route to D.H.S. for us.

00:34:05.752 --> 00:34:07.169
D.C. Metro, this is the F.B.I.,

00:34:07.254 --> 00:34:08.295
requesting you to clear a route...

00:34:12.217 --> 00:34:14.301
Farrell just resurfaced on the grid.

00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:16.262
Feds are taking him to Homeland.

00:34:16.346 --> 00:34:18.222
Good. Close that loop now.

00:34:18.306 --> 00:34:20.057
Isolate the frequency.

00:34:20.142 --> 00:34:22.059
Get us a location
on the vehicles

00:34:22.144 --> 00:34:23.811
and pull me up a file
on thisJohn McClane.

00:34:25.063 --> 00:34:27.022
Rand, we just found Farrell.

00:34:27.107 --> 00:34:28.190
Stand by for a location.

00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:34.113
Look, I don't mean
to harp, guys,

00:34:34.197 --> 00:34:36.407
but wejust passed another
Arby's and I'm starving.

00:34:36.491 --> 00:34:38.659
- I-I could eat a wrapper.
- Later. Shut up.

00:34:38.744 --> 00:34:40.244
- You don't even have to order anything.
- Shut up.

00:34:40.328 --> 00:34:41.912
-Just get some ketchup packets.
- Shut up.

00:34:41.997 --> 00:34:45.249
You got about 1 4 minutes
to tell me whyyou lied to me back there.

00:34:45.333 --> 00:34:47.251
Lied to you?
What are you talking about?

00:34:47.335 --> 00:34:49.378
The pictures on the wall,
you knew those guys, right?

00:34:49.463 --> 00:34:52.465
- I don't... l...
- Kid, don't lie to me.

00:34:52.549 --> 00:34:54.175
I'm a cop; I can tell you're lying.

00:34:54.259 --> 00:34:55.760
Who were they?

00:34:58.805 --> 00:35:00.264
Okay.

00:35:00.348 --> 00:35:01.223
Okay, okay.

00:35:03.518 --> 00:35:06.687
They were my competition.

00:35:08.899 --> 00:35:10.107
Make the next right

00:35:10.192 --> 00:35:11.525
onto Concord.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:13.611
They said they were a software firm
that had developed

00:35:13.695 --> 00:35:16.030
a mutating encryption algorithm,
and theyjust wanted

00:35:16.114 --> 00:35:17.615
to see if it could be cracked.

00:35:17.699 --> 00:35:20.993
That's what I do. I do...
I-I do math-based security.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:26.707
FARRELL:
Here's the thing: the thing that I've been

00:35:26.792 --> 00:35:27.917
thinking about is,
ifyou're gonna pull

00:35:28.001 --> 00:35:30.002
something as-as massive
and crazy as a fire sale,

00:35:30.086 --> 00:35:32.129
you'd need tons ofstart-up guys
to write the programs,

00:35:32.214 --> 00:35:34.173
but only a few black hats
to actually implement it,

00:35:34.257 --> 00:35:35.508
so then at
that point,

00:35:35.592 --> 00:35:36.967
the start-up guys,

00:35:37.052 --> 00:35:38.886
the guys who haven't really
done anything wrong, like me...

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:41.430
Would end up as pictures
on some guy's wall.

00:35:41.515 --> 00:35:43.098
I swear to God, McClane...

00:35:43.183 --> 00:35:44.266
I swear to you,

00:35:44.351 --> 00:35:46.894
I had no idea I was gonna be...

00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:49.980
an accessory to-to-to Armageddon.

00:35:50.065 --> 00:35:51.273
Take the next left at Lexington.

00:35:52.692 --> 00:35:55.402
Man, that's a sexy voice.

00:35:55.487 --> 00:35:56.862
What's she taking us this way for?

00:35:56.947 --> 00:35:58.614
- Unit 51 0, this is dispatch.
- Oh, my God.

00:35:58.698 --> 00:36:00.991
Clear a route for two F.B.I.
vehicles approaching on Concord.

00:36:01.076 --> 00:36:03.118
Copy, Dispatch.

00:36:03.203 --> 00:36:04.703
- F.B.I., we've cleared a path.
- That's her.

00:36:04.788 --> 00:36:06.789
- Her who?
- What are you talking about?

00:36:08.959 --> 00:36:10.084
FARRELL:
It's them.

00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:11.335
McCLANE:
You're saying it's them them?

00:36:11.419 --> 00:36:13.712
FARRELL:
I swear to you, I know her.

00:36:13.797 --> 00:36:15.256
I would know her voice anywhere.

00:36:16.341 --> 00:36:17.341
Don't say anything, don't...

00:36:17.425 --> 00:36:20.761
Just keep your mouth
shut for a minute.

00:36:20.846 --> 00:36:21.887
Hey, Metro,

00:36:21.972 --> 00:36:23.514
how's your day going over there?

00:36:23.598 --> 00:36:25.975
McCLANE:
Yeah, got to be pretty, uh, crazy over there, what,

00:36:26.059 --> 00:36:27.768
with all those 587s, huh?

00:36:27.853 --> 00:36:28.811
Yes, sir.

00:36:28.895 --> 00:36:30.187
We've had to dispatch all units.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.691
Yeah, you had
to dispatch all units

00:36:33.775 --> 00:36:34.817
for all the naked people

00:36:34.901 --> 00:36:36.402
walking around?

00:36:36.486 --> 00:36:37.903
Cut the bullshit, honey,

00:36:37.988 --> 00:36:39.947
and just put your boss on.

00:36:40.907 --> 00:36:42.575
Laughlin,

00:36:42.659 --> 00:36:43.784
we're getting offthis route.

00:36:43.869 --> 00:36:45.536
Make a left here on 1 4th Street.

00:36:53.503 --> 00:36:56.005
Officer McClane.

00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:57.548
It's Detective McClane, asshole.

00:36:57.632 --> 00:36:59.133
But don't worry,
we're gonna have

00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:01.385
plenty oftime
to get to know each other

00:37:01.469 --> 00:37:03.220
when I come visit you in prison.

00:37:03.305 --> 00:37:07.057
But,John, I already know
so much about you.

00:37:07.142 --> 00:37:08.183
Your address in Brooklyn,

00:37:08.268 --> 00:37:10.311
the payments on your mortgage,

00:37:10.395 --> 00:37:14.064
how long you've been
a member ofthe N.Y.P.D.

00:37:14.149 --> 00:37:15.900
And how's Holly?

00:37:15.984 --> 00:37:18.193
Oh, that's sad.
You're divorced.

00:37:18.278 --> 00:37:20.154
Was that tough
on littleJack and Lucy?

00:37:21.448 --> 00:37:24.533
Now, this is sad—
after 30 years, I thought

00:37:24.618 --> 00:37:27.202
you'd have a better pension plan
annuity than what I see here.

00:37:27.287 --> 00:37:28.287
Oh.

00:37:28.371 --> 00:37:29.371
And it gets worse.

00:37:32.792 --> 00:37:33.959
Your 401 k

00:37:34.044 --> 00:37:35.878
no longer exists.

00:37:35.962 --> 00:37:37.838
Tell you what.
Let me make it up to you.

00:37:37.923 --> 00:37:40.382
Box them in at that intersection.

00:37:40.467 --> 00:37:41.759
Shoot Mr. Farrell

00:37:41.843 --> 00:37:43.552
in the head and drive away,

00:37:43.637 --> 00:37:45.888
and by the time you reach
the end ofthe next block,

00:37:45.972 --> 00:37:48.933
all your debts
will be wiped clean,

00:37:49.017 --> 00:37:51.310
and your children
will be set for life.

00:37:51.394 --> 00:37:52.811
McCLANE:
Now, that

00:37:52.896 --> 00:37:55.689
really is tempting,
especially that last part.

00:37:55.774 --> 00:37:57.566
But I think I'm gonna have
to pass,jerkoff.

00:37:58.944 --> 00:38:01.362
John...

00:38:01.446 --> 00:38:04.239
you're a Timex watch
in a digital age.

00:38:04.324 --> 00:38:05.491
You're gonna lose.

00:38:05.575 --> 00:38:07.701
Yeah, well... the other thing

00:38:07.786 --> 00:38:10.120
that could happen is,
I could come and find you,

00:38:10.205 --> 00:38:12.331
kickyour ass and throwyou
out ofyour own party.

00:38:12.415 --> 00:38:13.749
What do you think
about that, dickhead?

00:38:13.833 --> 00:38:16.210
Hold your position.

00:38:17.754 --> 00:38:19.505
He's not responding.

00:38:22.842 --> 00:38:26.178
Get down! Get down! Get down!

00:38:30.934 --> 00:38:31.725
Just stay down!

00:38:35.855 --> 00:38:37.731
Officers down,

00:38:37.816 --> 00:38:39.024
the corner of Main and Constitution!

00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:40.275
I repeat: Officers down!

00:38:57.085 --> 00:39:00.087
Come on! Come on! Get out!
Let's go! Let's go!

00:39:02.674 --> 00:39:04.466
Goddamn it!

00:39:04.551 --> 00:39:06.635
Just stay down!

00:39:10.348 --> 00:39:13.058
Get down!

00:39:13.143 --> 00:39:14.977
Just hang on!

00:39:22.986 --> 00:39:25.279
We've got a squad car under fire!

00:39:25.363 --> 00:39:26.280
We need backup!

00:39:26.364 --> 00:39:27.781
I repeat: We need backup!

00:39:27.866 --> 00:39:30.534
This is base.
We're sending backup.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.957
Brace yourself.

00:39:52.515 --> 00:39:53.640
Hang on. Hang on.

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:11.992
Hang on.

00:40:21.711 --> 00:40:23.337
Yeah!

00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:30.302
- We lost Del.
- Stay with them.

00:40:41.022 --> 00:40:42.731
- They're back.
- I know.

00:40:45.902 --> 00:40:47.528
Take the tunnel, left, left, left.

00:41:04.337 --> 00:41:06.588
Bring up the schematics
on that tunnel.

00:41:06.673 --> 00:41:08.215
The tunnel!

00:41:16.641 --> 00:41:19.268
Open the gates
on the north side entrance.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.278
Redirect traffic.
Occupy all lanes.

00:41:46.462 --> 00:41:48.422
- Open the other side.
- What?

00:41:49.257 --> 00:41:50.591
Move!

00:41:54.762 --> 00:41:56.138
Just hang on to something!

00:42:33.134 --> 00:42:35.802
Hey! Hey!
Don't get out ofthe car! Hey!

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.811
McCLANE:
Just stay there! Stand still!

00:42:55.615 --> 00:42:57.032
Run!

00:43:04.999 --> 00:43:06.083
Oh, God.

00:43:11.005 --> 00:43:13.423
Don't ever hesitate like that again.

00:43:14.676 --> 00:43:15.968
Are you all right?

00:43:16.052 --> 00:43:17.844
Yeah. Yeah.

00:43:17.929 --> 00:43:20.764
- MAN: Are you okay?
- MAN 2: I can't move my arm!

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:23.892
Just stay here.
Stay right here

00:43:23.977 --> 00:43:25.269
- for a minute, all right?
- What?

00:43:25.353 --> 00:43:28.021
"Can't be a uniform,John. No."

00:43:28.106 --> 00:43:30.607
Get over to the wall, sir!

00:43:30.692 --> 00:43:32.651
"Feds called in a favor!"

00:43:32.735 --> 00:43:36.571
Yeah. "All you got to do
is go pick up a kid

00:43:36.656 --> 00:43:39.992
in Jersey and drive him down to D.C."

00:43:40.076 --> 00:43:41.493
How hard can that be, huh?

00:43:41.577 --> 00:43:43.578
Can't be that hard, no, can it?

00:43:43.663 --> 00:43:46.456
No, gotta be a senior detective.

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:53.839
A thing like a trafficjam,

00:43:53.923 --> 00:43:56.675
throwing a car at me's
gonna stop me, huh?

00:43:56.759 --> 00:43:58.885
Rand, get in there, get it done.

00:44:13.067 --> 00:44:15.360
This is not a good idea.

00:44:37.759 --> 00:44:39.718
Ha-ha.

00:44:39.802 --> 00:44:42.012
Oh...

00:44:51.189 --> 00:44:53.482
Oh...

00:44:53.566 --> 00:44:56.318
- Don't touch! Don't touch me.
- Oh, okay. Sorry, sorry.

00:44:56.402 --> 00:44:57.652
Are you okay?

00:44:57.737 --> 00:44:58.695
Oh, my God.

00:45:00.615 --> 00:45:02.783
Pretty lucky shot, huh?

00:45:02.867 --> 00:45:04.034
Yeah, lucky.

00:45:04.118 --> 00:45:07.537
That was— You just killed
a helicopter with a car.

00:45:07.622 --> 00:45:09.664
I was out of bullets.

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:13.794
How you doing?

00:45:13.878 --> 00:45:15.879
I-I skinned my knee,
and my asthma's acting up

00:45:15.963 --> 00:45:17.714
a little bit, but...

00:45:17.799 --> 00:45:20.217
Whatever. Yeah, I'm fine.

00:45:20.301 --> 00:45:23.637
I'm getting too old
tojump out ofcars.

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:35.232
Rand, check in.

00:45:37.944 --> 00:45:39.569
What about Farrell and McClane?

00:45:42.949 --> 00:45:44.032
Come back in.

00:45:44.117 --> 00:45:46.284
Okay, we're moving on.
Begin stage three.

00:45:46.369 --> 00:45:47.911
I just spoke to Emerson.

00:45:47.995 --> 00:45:48.870
The team's arriving

00:45:48.955 --> 00:45:51.957
- at Woodlawn now.
- Very good.

00:45:52.041 --> 00:45:54.418
Mai, get ready for the downloads.

00:46:00.633 --> 00:46:02.050
I.D., sir.

00:46:03.386 --> 00:46:04.886
Park behind the transpo.

00:46:04.971 --> 00:46:06.012
We'll lead you in.

00:46:06.097 --> 00:46:07.180
Man the gate.

00:46:07.265 --> 00:46:08.682
You're with me.

00:46:15.398 --> 00:46:17.983
Anthrax alarms only went off
on five floors.

00:46:18.067 --> 00:46:20.944
Below that, you'll
need D.O.D. clearance.

00:46:21.028 --> 00:46:23.071
I don't know whyyou'd
need to go any further.

00:46:23.156 --> 00:46:25.073
There's nothing down there
but servers.

00:46:31.456 --> 00:46:35.333
Go again. Rodriguez?
Please copy.

00:46:48.681 --> 00:46:50.765
Gate secured.

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:51.892
Copy.

00:47:00.943 --> 00:47:02.819
Okay, we are in.

00:47:37.647 --> 00:47:39.648
This is insane. Hey.

00:47:39.732 --> 00:47:41.566
Hey, this is absurd.

00:47:41.651 --> 00:47:44.194
Man, there's tough
and there's stupid.

00:47:44.278 --> 00:47:47.197
You got to go to a
hospital. Look at you.

00:47:47.281 --> 00:47:49.866
I'm not a doctor, but you
look like you're hurt.

00:47:49.951 --> 00:47:52.035
- Yeah. Sexy, right?
- No.

00:47:52.119 --> 00:47:53.286
Come on.

00:47:53.371 --> 00:47:55.997
We don't need a doctor.
We need the cops.

00:48:23.484 --> 00:48:25.360
He's in.

00:48:26.862 --> 00:48:28.238
Get out ofthe way!
Look out!

00:48:28.322 --> 00:48:29.614
Make a hole, please! Come on.

00:48:30.741 --> 00:48:32.325
McCLANE:
Watch out! Excuse me! Excuse me!

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:34.286
Come on. N.Y.P.D.

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:35.996
All right?
I got this kid.

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.414
Come on, let's go, kid.

00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:43.878
- Hold on.
- It's okay.

00:48:43.963 --> 00:48:46.256
Yeah. Okay. Thanks.
N.Y.P.D.

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.675
You all right?

00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:50.010
Sergeant.

00:48:50.094 --> 00:48:51.928
Sergeant!

00:48:52.013 --> 00:48:53.763
I need to speak to you.

00:48:53.848 --> 00:48:56.141
- The medic's in the back.
- I'm all right.

00:48:56.225 --> 00:48:57.684
N.Y.P.D.
I got to talk to you.

00:48:58.894 --> 00:49:00.604
Just give me a minute.

00:49:00.688 --> 00:49:03.690
Sergeant.

00:49:07.236 --> 00:49:09.237
Oh, my God.

00:49:14.368 --> 00:49:16.328
Let's get out of here.

00:49:24.003 --> 00:49:25.754
Pronto. Open, open.

00:49:30.217 --> 00:49:32.135
We're a go.

00:49:32.219 --> 00:49:34.179
Launch the downloads.

00:49:45.024 --> 00:49:46.941
Nothing's happening.

00:49:47.026 --> 00:49:49.736
Be patient.

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.613
l don't know.
It's not responding.

00:49:51.697 --> 00:49:53.406
Wait for it.

00:49:57.745 --> 00:49:59.287
See?

00:49:59.372 --> 00:50:00.914
There you go.

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:05.627
- Let me know when the download reaches 20%.
- Okay.

00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:10.090
Please remain calm.

00:50:12.343 --> 00:50:13.927
Excuse me.

00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:17.597
Excuse me! Thankyou!

00:50:17.682 --> 00:50:19.849
Holy shit.

00:50:19.934 --> 00:50:22.852
- Kid? Kid. Hey.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:50:22.937 --> 00:50:25.063
- You got a phone in that bag?
- Yeah.

00:50:25.147 --> 00:50:28.191
Come on. Let's go.

00:50:30.528 --> 00:50:32.404
And here you go, Agent... Tovarek.

00:50:32.488 --> 00:50:34.531
Guess that's you.

00:50:55.636 --> 00:50:57.512
Download's at 20%.

00:50:57.596 --> 00:50:59.347
Time to move.

00:50:59.432 --> 00:51:02.475
Let's keep them chasing their tails.

00:51:17.324 --> 00:51:19.242
TV REPORTER:
Due to recent activity,

00:51:19.326 --> 00:51:22.287
law enforcement agencies
are being extremely cautious.

00:51:22.371 --> 00:51:25.915
They are telling drivers
to abandon their vehicles

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.751
until they are searched.

00:51:27.835 --> 00:51:30.754
And as you can see, canine units
are checking each vehicle.

00:51:30.838 --> 00:51:33.548
Now, whether this is
connected to the anthrax reports

00:51:33.632 --> 00:51:37.093
we heard earlier or for
some new terrorist threat...

00:51:37.178 --> 00:51:38.720
F.A.A.just grounded all flights.

00:51:38.804 --> 00:51:41.097
- Good.
- Sir, we have complete access

00:51:41.182 --> 00:51:43.308
over system networks:
the phones, power grids,

00:51:43.392 --> 00:51:44.350
water, nuclear.

00:51:45.686 --> 00:51:46.519
Hey, excuse me...

00:51:46.604 --> 00:51:47.854
Jack Parry, N.S.A.

00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:50.815
Chuck Summer, D.H.S. liaison.
White House made the call.

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:52.484
Anything you need,

00:51:52.568 --> 00:51:54.068
- we're here to help.
- Help.

00:51:54.153 --> 00:51:56.196
Wow, that's... that's great.

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:58.448
We're gonna need some
work space for our people.

00:51:58.532 --> 00:52:00.450
What can you do for us?

00:52:00.534 --> 00:52:02.660
Well, as you can see,
we're using the space.

00:52:02.745 --> 00:52:04.621
So you guys can stand
in the corner,

00:52:04.705 --> 00:52:05.663
and, uh, liaise.

00:52:05.748 --> 00:52:06.664
If I need something,

00:52:06.749 --> 00:52:09.209
I'll just wave to you.

00:52:30.731 --> 00:52:32.273
FARRELL:
Wait.

00:52:32.358 --> 00:52:33.858
- No, no. Don't-don't-don't call.
- Why?

00:52:33.943 --> 00:52:35.985
- What are you talking about?
- They probably cracked that hours ago.

00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:38.822
You use it, they might be able to trace us.
Just put it in your pocket.

00:52:38.906 --> 00:52:40.907
- You sure?
- Yes.

00:52:40.991 --> 00:52:43.076
Or... smash it.
You didn't have to smash it.

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:46.454
- Excuse me. Excuse me. It's a police emergency.
- Hey!

00:52:46.539 --> 00:52:48.164
He'll call you right back.

00:52:49.208 --> 00:52:51.334
Here. Right in here.
Come here.

00:52:52.545 --> 00:52:54.337
- You got a signal?
- Yeah.

00:52:54.421 --> 00:52:57.006
- Yeah?
- This is John McClane

00:52:57.091 --> 00:52:58.299
for Agent Bowman.

00:52:58.384 --> 00:53:02.345
Sir,John McClane is on the line.

00:53:02.429 --> 00:53:05.098
- McClane, go.
- We never made it to D.H.S.

00:53:05.182 --> 00:53:06.808
They came after the kid again.

00:53:06.892 --> 00:53:08.017
All your men are down.

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:11.312
What about Farrell?

00:53:11.397 --> 00:53:12.856
Yeah, I got him with me

00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:15.650
- right now.
- Sir?
- Hang on,John.

00:53:15.734 --> 00:53:17.360
Yeah, I'll hold on.

00:53:22.408 --> 00:53:24.033
Another day in paradise.

00:53:24.118 --> 00:53:26.119
They just swarmed into everything.

00:53:26.203 --> 00:53:27.537
The whole telecom system: phones,

00:53:27.621 --> 00:53:29.289
cells, broadcast satellites.

00:53:41.051 --> 00:53:42.927
They're blanketing every station.

00:54:09.455 --> 00:54:11.706
Can you put the news back on?

00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:13.333
This is the news.

00:54:13.417 --> 00:54:14.751
It's on every channel.

00:54:14.835 --> 00:54:18.963
Been this way for a few minutes now.

00:54:34.396 --> 00:54:35.605
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:54:43.197 --> 00:54:45.865
McClane.

00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:48.701
Look out! Look out!

00:54:50.996 --> 00:54:52.455
Look out!

00:54:52.539 --> 00:54:54.791
Bowman.

00:54:54.875 --> 00:54:56.209
- Bowman, do you see that?
- McClane.

00:54:56.293 --> 00:54:58.670
Bowman, it's a fake.

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.425
I see it.

00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:06.344
Thank God.

00:55:06.428 --> 00:55:09.389
Oh, shit.

00:55:09.473 --> 00:55:11.557
McClane?

00:55:11.642 --> 00:55:13.101
Bowman?

00:55:16.897 --> 00:55:19.315
Satellite's down.

00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:20.608
Get me a landline.

00:55:22.236 --> 00:55:23.820
Shit.

00:55:35.916 --> 00:55:37.500
Wrote one little piece ofcode

00:55:37.584 --> 00:55:39.335
and the world falls apart.

00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:41.462
This is virtual terrorism.

00:55:41.547 --> 00:55:43.548
- What?
- You know, it's crazy,

00:55:43.632 --> 00:55:46.175
first I time I heard
ofthe concept ofa fire sale,

00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:48.177
I actually thought
it would be cool

00:55:48.262 --> 00:55:49.721
ifanyone ever really did it.

00:55:49.805 --> 00:55:53.558
Just... hit the reset button.

00:55:53.642 --> 00:55:55.852
Melt the system just for fun.

00:55:55.936 --> 00:55:58.354
Hey, it's not a system.

00:55:58.439 --> 00:55:59.856
It's a country.

00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:00.982
You're talking about people.

00:56:01.066 --> 00:56:02.775
All right? A whole
country full of people.

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:03.985
Sitting at home,

00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:05.820
alone, scared to death
in their houses, all right?

00:56:05.904 --> 00:56:08.197
So ifyou're done with
your little nostalgic moment,

00:56:08.282 --> 00:56:09.824
maybe you can think a little bit

00:56:09.908 --> 00:56:13.161
and help me catch these guys.

00:56:13.245 --> 00:56:14.495
Just help me.

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:17.206
Just put yourself in their shoes.

00:56:17.291 --> 00:56:20.376
- Come on. Ifthis were your fire sale,
- Okay, okay.

00:56:20.461 --> 00:56:23.713
- you were running this thing,
what would be your next move?
- Okay, uh...

00:56:23.797 --> 00:56:25.798
Well, the whole point
ofa fire sale

00:56:25.883 --> 00:56:27.884
is that it-it's mostly
done by remote, right?

00:56:27.968 --> 00:56:33.389
But... but not everything is run completely online.
Uh, uh, major utilities aren't.

00:56:33.474 --> 00:56:38.186
They're run by closed-circuit, so you could
breach the security up to a certain point, but, um,

00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:40.480
to shut it down,
you would have to physically go there.

00:56:40.564 --> 00:56:42.398
You'd have to show up,
right, and-and, uh...

00:56:42.483 --> 00:56:45.068
You know what?
Give me that guy's P.D.A.

00:56:45.152 --> 00:56:46.736
The phones don't work.
They're all dead.

00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:48.905
No, the phones are fine;
it's the network that's dead.

00:56:48.989 --> 00:56:50.865
I'vejust got to reprogram it

00:56:50.949 --> 00:56:52.408
and link it into the old SATCOMs.

00:56:52.493 --> 00:56:53.409
Hackers surf'em

00:56:53.494 --> 00:56:54.869
all the time―
that's probably

00:56:54.953 --> 00:56:56.037
what these guys are using

00:56:56.121 --> 00:56:57.038
to talk to each other.

00:56:57.122 --> 00:56:58.247
How do you know all this stuff?

00:56:58.332 --> 00:56:59.957
Dude, I don't know.

00:57:00.042 --> 00:57:02.001
There's a lot rattling around
up there.

00:57:02.086 --> 00:57:03.336
I couldn't tell you.

00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:06.214
Okay. National power grid— uh,

00:57:06.298 --> 00:57:08.216
gas and electric is divided
into three zones, right?

00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:11.385
Eastern, central and western,
each with a primary hub.

00:57:12.513 --> 00:57:14.514
Here it is.

00:57:14.598 --> 00:57:16.099
What is that?

00:57:16.183 --> 00:57:18.601
- What are we looking at?
- That is the eastern hub.

00:57:18.685 --> 00:57:20.686
Now, they take this out...

00:57:20.771 --> 00:57:24.148
wipes out all the power for
the entire eastern corridor.

00:57:24.233 --> 00:57:26.109
But again, you'd have
to do it manually.

00:57:26.193 --> 00:57:29.487
Okay...
Come on. Let's go.

00:57:29.571 --> 00:57:30.905
What, to West Virginia?

00:57:30.989 --> 00:57:32.406
Hey, I-I honestly don't think

00:57:32.491 --> 00:57:34.700
I can handle any more people
trying to kill me.

00:57:34.785 --> 00:57:35.827
McClane? McClane?

00:57:35.911 --> 00:57:36.953
Well, you get used to it.

00:57:37.037 --> 00:57:38.246
McClane... Oh, shit.

00:57:38.330 --> 00:57:39.789
Sir, wireless
networks are down,

00:57:39.873 --> 00:57:42.125
and l think they're hitting
the landlines, too.

00:57:42.209 --> 00:57:46.087
I don't care how.
You find me a line.

00:57:46.171 --> 00:57:47.797
Come on. Whatcha got?

00:57:47.881 --> 00:57:50.424
We swept the whole building.
Seems clean. We can sweep it again.

00:57:50.509 --> 00:57:53.636
- I don't think we're gonna find anything.
- Don't bother. Don't bother.

00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:55.513
It's a fake.

00:57:55.597 --> 00:57:57.223
This guy's playing us.

00:57:57.307 --> 00:58:00.351
Okay, get everyone back inside
the crisis center now.

00:58:00.435 --> 00:58:02.228
Okay. Let's open it up!

00:58:04.398 --> 00:58:06.315
Come on. Get in.

00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.484
Door's locked,

00:58:08.569 --> 00:58:10.987
unless you have an extra gun
I can use to unlock it.

00:58:13.073 --> 00:58:16.951
Hey, hey, don't do that.
Hey! You're gonna disable it.

00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:19.662
Jesus Christ!

00:58:19.746 --> 00:58:21.998
Oh! That was crazy.
Did you see that?

00:58:22.082 --> 00:58:23.499
Sorry about that, man.

00:58:23.584 --> 00:58:26.252
l didn't know
it would come out so fast.

00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:30.548
Uh... man...

00:58:30.632 --> 00:58:32.008
How'd you do yours?

00:58:34.428 --> 00:58:35.678
You all right?

00:58:35.762 --> 00:58:39.682
What'd you...? What, it hit you
a little bit? Sorry.

00:58:42.394 --> 00:58:44.020
Oh, no, listen, do-do not...

00:58:44.104 --> 00:58:46.939
Please don't touch those, okay?
I know what I'm doing. I've done this before.

00:58:47.024 --> 00:58:49.233
I mean, I-I've read about it.

00:58:49.318 --> 00:58:53.070

and my-my my dad is having
a heart attack.

00:58:57.951 --> 00:59:00.119

Please, listen to me.
I-I can get him to a hospital.

00:59:07.544 --> 00:59:08.836
I can drive. I'm fine.

00:59:08.921 --> 00:59:10.296
But I can't really turn the key.

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:12.548
The key won't start,
so you gotta start

00:59:12.633 --> 00:59:14.217

Okay, Dolores, uh, I don't know
ifyou have a dad, but I do,

00:59:45.666 --> 00:59:48.209
and I want to be able to say
that a year from now, okay?

00:59:48.293 --> 00:59:49.752
Because my dad
is my hero,

00:59:49.836 --> 00:59:52.088
and right now
he is in my arms dying.

00:59:52.172 --> 00:59:55.466

01:00:02.849 --> 01:00:05.059
Thank you, Dolores.

01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:07.520
Pass me the P.D.A.
I gotta call the Warlock.

01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:08.854
- The what?
- The Warlock.

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:11.232
He's a digital Jedi.
He's amazing.

01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:30.418
Ma'am, you're not
authorized to be here.

01:00:30.502 --> 01:00:33.212
F.B.I. We suspect there's
been a security breach.

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:35.715
No, you can't land here
without authoriza...

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:56.777
That was pretty good
back there, kid.

01:00:56.862 --> 01:00:59.613
Thanks.

01:00:59.698 --> 01:01:03.326
What's the matter with you?
Nothing else to complain about?

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:05.995
No.Just...

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:07.163
What?
What's the matter with you?

01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:08.581
It's not funny.
I'm not like you.

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:10.750
I can't... I can't do this shit.

01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:12.752
What do you mean?
What's that mean? Like what?

01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:16.672
I'm not, like... like heroic
and everything, l'm...

01:01:16.757 --> 01:01:18.257
not brave like you are.

01:01:18.342 --> 01:01:19.467
I'm not that guy.

01:01:19.551 --> 01:01:21.052
I'm nobody's hero, kid.

01:01:21.136 --> 01:01:23.721
You saved my life, like, ten
times in the last six hours.

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:25.556
Just doing myjob, that's all.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.016
Ah...

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:31.479
Know what you get
for being a hero? Nothing.

01:01:31.563 --> 01:01:33.064
You get shot at.

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:35.358
You get a little pat
on the back, blah-blah-blah.

01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:37.610
That-a-boy!

01:01:39.863 --> 01:01:42.531
Get divorced.

01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:44.617
A wife that can't remember
your last name.

01:01:45.786 --> 01:01:49.121
Kids don't want to talk to you.

01:01:49.206 --> 01:01:52.625
Get to eat a lot of meals
byyourself.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:55.169
Trust me, kid.
Nobody wants to be that guy.

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:58.005
Then why you doing this?

01:01:58.090 --> 01:02:00.800
Because there's nobody else
to do it right now, that's why.

01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:02.510
Believe me, ifthere was
somebody else to do it,

01:02:02.594 --> 01:02:04.261
I would let them do it,
but there's not,

01:02:04.346 --> 01:02:05.846
so we're doing it.

01:02:07.766 --> 01:02:11.185
Ah... and that's what
makes you that guy.

01:02:19.319 --> 01:02:21.362
Thing's flying now.

01:02:21.446 --> 01:02:25.116
Contact Emerson.
Tell him we'll be there soon.

01:02:31.665 --> 01:02:34.375
What the hell are you doing?
This whole floor's restricted access.

01:03:00.068 --> 01:03:01.694
Stay here.

01:03:30.932 --> 01:03:32.683
All right, come on.

01:03:32.767 --> 01:03:33.976
Okay.

01:03:51.495 --> 01:03:52.620
We're in.

01:03:52.704 --> 01:03:53.746
Good. Shut it down.

01:04:06.134 --> 01:04:08.052
Guess you were right, kid.

01:04:08.136 --> 01:04:10.095
Okay, that's... awful.

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:13.891
We got company.

01:04:22.567 --> 01:04:24.443
So, how would they shut down

01:04:24.528 --> 01:04:25.486
the power grid?

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:26.487
What?

01:04:26.571 --> 01:04:27.488
Come on!

01:04:27.572 --> 01:04:28.822
Uh... central control room.

01:04:28.907 --> 01:04:30.115
Okay.

01:04:31.243 --> 01:04:32.910
Uh... fourth floor.

01:04:32.994 --> 01:04:34.954
- Fourth floor!
- Come on!

01:04:36.957 --> 01:04:38.958
- Take the right.
- Right.

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:44.838
Oh...

01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:47.299
Shh!

01:04:48.468 --> 01:04:50.427
- I'm gonna stop here for...
- Just try to keep up.

01:04:50.512 --> 01:04:53.931
I am keeping up. I just want to stop
for two seconds to catch a breath.

01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:55.891
You know, they have these
things called gymnasiums.

01:04:55.976 --> 01:04:57.685
It's not like they're...

01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:20.332
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go!

01:05:27.132 --> 01:05:28.799
Right.

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:35.139
Intel's fairly certain that
the terrorists are mobile.

01:05:35.223 --> 01:05:38.601
It's the only way
to consistently avoid signal triangulation,

01:05:38.685 --> 01:05:41.520
and judging by the amount
of hardware they're running,

01:05:41.605 --> 01:05:43.606
we're probably looking
for a large vehicle,

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:46.442
most likely a semitrailer rig.

01:05:46.526 --> 01:05:49.236
All right, tell the guys at
Homeland Security we need every

01:05:49.321 --> 01:05:52.656
agent, satellite and functioning
network they got— now.

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:13.719
McCLANE:
Playtime's over, sweetheart.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:17.056
Don't.
Take your hand offthe gun.

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:19.558
Hands up.
Stand up.

01:06:26.107 --> 01:06:27.608
Go on, now!

01:06:29.027 --> 01:06:31.779
Let's go, kid.
You're up.

01:06:31.863 --> 01:06:32.863
Okay.

01:06:35.116 --> 01:06:36.742
As fast as you can. Hey!

01:06:39.454 --> 01:06:40.871
Jesus!

01:06:40.955 --> 01:06:42.247
Oh!

01:06:58.181 --> 01:06:59.807
That's enough ofthis kung fu shit.

01:06:59.891 --> 01:07:02.226
I've known
some bitches in my day,

01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:04.520
but you are the biggest...

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:07.064
Okay, uh...

01:07:08.817 --> 01:07:09.358
Uh...

01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:11.402
Still awake, huh?

01:07:11.486 --> 01:07:13.278
Just keep doing what you're doing.

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:15.239
- Okay.
- How much time do you need?

01:07:15.323 --> 01:07:16.407
Um, um... not much.

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:26.917
Whoo!

01:07:28.712 --> 01:07:30.337
Are you done?

01:07:31.423 --> 01:07:32.339
I...

01:07:32.424 --> 01:07:33.340
Are you done?

01:07:33.425 --> 01:07:35.050
- No, no, not quite.
- What?

01:07:35.135 --> 01:07:37.469
I'm not exactly checking
my e-mail here, you know?

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:40.931
They ran this hack in V.M.O.,
so I'm isolating theirA.P.I.,

01:07:41.015 --> 01:07:42.808
- and just booting the host.
- What?!

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:45.728
It means about 30 seconds, okay?

01:07:45.812 --> 01:07:48.689
Not the easiest thing to do when...

01:08:00.452 --> 01:08:03.454
Okay!

01:08:03.538 --> 01:08:05.205
Undo everything you just did... now!

01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:08.208
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:08:08.293 --> 01:08:10.085
I'm a righty. I'm a righty.

01:08:10.170 --> 01:08:13.046
I'm a righty. I need my
other hand. I really do.

01:08:14.215 --> 01:08:15.424
I'm a righty.

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:49.875
One last door to open.

01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:53.128
Do you know what you're doing?

01:08:53.213 --> 01:08:55.756
I mean, do you realize what
this'll do to the country?

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.758
Yes, I do.

01:08:57.842 --> 01:08:59.510
Now open the door.

01:08:59.594 --> 01:09:01.220
Okay, good.

01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:03.514
Glad we're on the same page.

01:09:10.021 --> 01:09:12.898
You do? I'm glad you know.

01:09:25.578 --> 01:09:26.787
Ooh!

01:09:28.957 --> 01:09:30.707
Howyou doing?

01:09:39.467 --> 01:09:41.426
Hang on!

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:57.044
Listen... let'sjust talk
about this for one...

01:11:01.841 --> 01:11:04.509
How you doing?

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:06.345
That's not too tight,
is it? Huh? Huh?

01:11:08.389 --> 01:11:10.307
Damn it!

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:13.560
Smile pretty!

01:11:48.179 --> 01:11:49.304
McClane!

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:53.934
Oh, shit.

01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:55.978
McClane, get outta there!

01:11:57.772 --> 01:11:58.939
Come on, man. Come on!

01:12:03.403 --> 01:12:04.569
Come on, man!

01:12:11.119 --> 01:12:12.786
Oh, God.

01:12:26.259 --> 01:12:27.884
Did you see that?

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:32.848
McCLANE:
So, you stopped it, right?

01:12:32.932 --> 01:12:34.850
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,
actually, having a gun

01:12:34.934 --> 01:12:37.352
to your head makes it harder
to do this kind ofwork.

01:12:37.437 --> 01:12:39.312
- What?!
- I know that comes as a surprise.

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:43.608
Shit.

01:12:43.693 --> 01:12:46.069
You can'tjust turn it
off?Just lock 'em out?

01:12:46.154 --> 01:12:47.154
I'm not sure.

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:52.284
I... might be able
to slow them down, though.

01:12:53.327 --> 01:12:55.245
Western and central hubs are ours.

01:12:55.329 --> 01:12:57.080
We'rejust waiting on Mai's end.

01:12:58.499 --> 01:13:00.000
Hang on.
Something's up.

01:13:00.084 --> 01:13:02.169
All the security's reactivating.

01:13:02.253 --> 01:13:04.212
I think someone might be

01:13:04.297 --> 01:13:06.673
in the market for some cheap Viagra.

01:13:06.758 --> 01:13:09.801
Why don't you take some ofthat?
Now that your girlfriend's dead,

01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:13.221
why don't you check out our sexy
singles that you can chat with?

01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:15.849
It's an e-bomb.

01:13:21.147 --> 01:13:23.815
Hey, h-hey...

01:13:28.029 --> 01:13:30.864
All right, all right, wait,
wait, wait.

01:13:33.159 --> 01:13:34.826
Mai, talk to me.
What's going on?

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:35.911
Mai?

01:13:35.995 --> 01:13:37.996
Oh, yeah.

01:13:38.081 --> 01:13:40.916
Little Asian chick,
likes to kick people?

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.167
I don't think she's gonna

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:44.086
be talking to anybody
for a really long time.

01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:48.006
Last time l saw her, she was at
the bottom ofan elevator shaft

01:13:48.091 --> 01:13:50.342
with an S.U.V.
rammed up her ass.

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:54.304
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

01:13:54.388 --> 01:13:57.933
Listen,jackass,
your fire sale's over.

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:01.603
So pack up your little circus,

01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:04.981
or I'm gonna come
and l'm gonna kickyour ass.

01:14:05.066 --> 01:14:10.445
You have no idea who I am
or what I am capable of.

01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:13.156
When I'm finished here—
and I promise it'll be soon—

01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:17.035
I will focus
all my attention on you.

01:14:18.538 --> 01:14:21.248
You want to make things
personal, fine.

01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:43.812
Reroute every cubic foot
of natural gas in the pipelines

01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:45.730
to that station.

01:14:46.774 --> 01:14:48.817
Can you get Bowman on this thing?

01:14:48.901 --> 01:14:51.570
Sure.
I can get anyone.

01:14:51.654 --> 01:14:52.571
Do it.

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:53.947
Now?

01:14:54.031 --> 01:14:55.073
Yeah. Now.

01:14:58.744 --> 01:14:59.828
Please, no...

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:02.789
It's Thomas Gabriel.

01:15:02.874 --> 01:15:03.582
Shit.

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:07.335
McCLANE:
You know this guy?!

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:10.672
I worked with him.
He was D.O.D.'s chief programmer

01:15:10.756 --> 01:15:12.215
for infrastructure security.

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.843
After 9/1 1 , he's the guy
that told Joint Chiers

01:15:14.927 --> 01:15:16.636
the system was vulnerable.

01:15:16.721 --> 01:15:18.763
He was pushing for total overhaul,
but they wouldn't listen.

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:20.557
Gabriel's not exactly
people-friendly.

01:15:20.641 --> 01:15:22.267
You think so?

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:23.518
When he tried to go public,

01:15:23.603 --> 01:15:25.562
they crucified him...

01:15:25.646 --> 01:15:27.314
destroyed his reputation.

01:15:27.398 --> 01:15:28.982
- Froze assets. After that,
- Uh...

01:15:29.066 --> 01:15:29.858
he disappeared.

01:15:29.942 --> 01:15:32.360
We got a pretty serious problem.

01:15:32.445 --> 01:15:34.654
Wh... hold on one minute. What?

01:15:34.739 --> 01:15:38.783
I think we need to get
out of here right now.

01:15:38.868 --> 01:15:40.160
They're sending the gas lines here.

01:15:40.244 --> 01:15:41.912
Gas lines? What gas lines?

01:15:41.996 --> 01:15:43.580
Christ.

01:15:43.664 --> 01:15:45.290
Oh...

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:48.043
all ofthem. See that?

01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:49.336
Those flashing arrows?
That's not good.

01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:50.462
All that's coming here?

01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:53.006
Yeah, I think we gotta go.

01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:55.133
He-Hey, listen,
I gotta go, I gotta go.

01:15:55.218 --> 01:15:56.509
Just find Thomas Gabriel.

01:15:56.594 --> 01:15:59.012
McClane? McClane?

01:15:59.096 --> 01:16:01.389
Let's go.
Let's go. Finish this up!

01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:09.564
Right now. Finish it up.
Come on. Let's go!

01:16:29.543 --> 01:16:31.002
Get in there!

01:17:16.882 --> 01:17:18.008
You okay?

01:17:23.556 --> 01:17:25.640
Let's go, come on.
Got to get out of here.

01:17:25.725 --> 01:17:27.684
Oh, what's the point?
Man, what is the point?

01:17:27.768 --> 01:17:29.519
Hey. Knock that off.
Come on.

01:17:29.603 --> 01:17:32.689
This has something to do with that code
you wrote for them. All right? Now think.

01:17:32.773 --> 01:17:34.274
Come on.
Help us win.

01:17:35.443 --> 01:17:36.860
Win?

01:17:36.944 --> 01:17:39.612
When do we start winning? Huh?

01:17:39.697 --> 01:17:41.531
Take a look around.
Are you out ofyour mind?

01:17:41.615 --> 01:17:43.325
Does it look like
we're even close to winning?

01:17:43.409 --> 01:17:45.076
Wejust got the shit
kicked out of us.

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:47.203
What, do you think
I'm holding out on you,

01:17:47.288 --> 01:17:48.747
there's something I'm
just not telling you?

01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:51.333
lf l knew what they
wanted, I would tell you.

01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:52.834
I would happily tell you.

01:17:52.918 --> 01:17:55.628
Jesus.

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:34.250
The Warlock.

01:18:34.335 --> 01:18:36.127
Oh, great. Ah!

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:37.670
There goes the cell phone.

01:18:37.755 --> 01:18:39.381
They knock the satellites
out ofthe skies now?

01:18:39.465 --> 01:18:41.383
No, your battery ran out.

01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:42.926
- Listen, we should go see him.
- Who?

01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:45.387
The Warlock, we should drive to his house.
He's not that far away.

01:18:45.471 --> 01:18:47.389
- He's in Baltimore.
- Can't go to Warlock's house.

01:18:47.473 --> 01:18:49.015
Hey, hey, hey,
you want me to help you.

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:50.058
This is me helping you.

01:18:50.142 --> 01:18:51.434
Okay? Trust me.

01:18:51.519 --> 01:18:52.894
We got to go see the Warlock.

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:54.187
It's our only hope.

01:18:59.610 --> 01:19:01.236
How do you feel about flying?

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:02.570
Uh, about what?

01:19:02.655 --> 01:19:03.863
You mean like with a pilot?

01:19:10.788 --> 01:19:12.747
Just stick it in the round thing.

01:19:12.832 --> 01:19:14.207
What brown thing?

01:19:14.291 --> 01:19:17.085
Here, put these on.

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:18.586
Just stick it in there.

01:19:18.671 --> 01:19:19.754
That'll work.

01:19:19.839 --> 01:19:21.047
You okay?

01:19:21.132 --> 01:19:24.592
Uh, yeah, I'm just
kind ofafraid offlying...

01:19:24.677 --> 01:19:26.344
Yeah, I used to be terrified
offlying.

01:19:26.429 --> 01:19:27.095
Really?

01:19:27.179 --> 01:19:28.388
Yeah. Took some lessons.

01:19:28.472 --> 01:19:29.931
You know, face your fears,
that kind ofthing.

01:19:30.015 --> 01:19:31.224
Yeah? Did it help?

01:19:31.308 --> 01:19:32.934
Not really.

01:19:33.018 --> 01:19:36.104
Is it...

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:39.149
Is it supposed to make that sound?

01:19:39.233 --> 01:19:40.775
Yeah.

01:19:42.403 --> 01:19:43.903
Maybe we should just drive.

01:19:43.988 --> 01:19:45.280
lt'll be fun, it'll
be like a road trip.

01:19:45.364 --> 01:19:47.323
Just take it easy. They say
taking off is the hardest part.

01:19:47.408 --> 01:19:48.533
Really? I... I heard...

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:50.410
To be honest,
I missed a couple ofclasses.

01:19:50.494 --> 01:19:53.121
Ha-ha-ha.
You did, really?

01:19:53.205 --> 01:19:56.541
But you have your license, right?
I mean, you can fly one ofthese, right?

01:19:57.710 --> 01:19:59.669
- Oh...
- Hey! Here we go.

01:19:59.753 --> 01:20:01.296
- Hey.
- We're up.

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:03.339
Oh, God.

01:20:05.718 --> 01:20:08.595
Okay. That's good.
That's pretty good.

01:20:10.514 --> 01:20:12.807
Jesus, look at that.

01:20:12.892 --> 01:20:14.809
This whole area is blacked out.

01:20:16.604 --> 01:20:19.105
How we going
to find Warlock's house?

01:20:19.190 --> 01:20:22.567
Um, it's probably gonna be the
one with the lights still on.

01:20:30.034 --> 01:20:31.493
Power outage keeps spreading.

01:20:31.577 --> 01:20:34.287
About halfthe East Coast
has already gone down.

01:20:34.371 --> 01:20:36.206
BOWMAN:
All right.

01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:38.708
Put everything
on emergency generators.

01:20:38.792 --> 01:20:41.878
How the hell
are they getting past us?

01:20:45.216 --> 01:20:46.341
FARRELL:
Uh, okay.

01:20:46.425 --> 01:20:47.800
Uh, down there, down there,
I see it.

01:20:47.885 --> 01:20:49.594
- Down there?
- Left, left, down.

01:20:54.433 --> 01:20:56.434
We're gonna land there?
We're gonna land down there?

01:20:58.229 --> 01:21:00.146
- All right, hang on.
- Okay, okay.

01:21:00.231 --> 01:21:01.356
Oh...

01:21:03.359 --> 01:21:03.900
Fence.

01:21:03.984 --> 01:21:05.235
Fence, fence.

01:21:07.655 --> 01:21:08.488
Fence, fence!

01:21:08.572 --> 01:21:09.989
I see...

01:21:10.074 --> 01:21:11.449
Watch...!

01:21:17.581 --> 01:21:20.250
Whoo!

01:21:20.334 --> 01:21:21.584
Oh...

01:21:22.586 --> 01:21:24.128
Oh.Jesus.

01:21:24.213 --> 01:21:25.380
Come on.

01:21:25.464 --> 01:21:28.508
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, taking
off is the hardest part.

01:21:28.592 --> 01:21:29.968
Let's go.

01:21:32.513 --> 01:21:35.056
FARRELL: Now, there's something
you need to know about Warlock.

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:37.892
He, he hates cops.
I mean, he hates them, okay?

01:21:37.977 --> 01:21:40.311
Sojust let me do all the talking.

01:21:49.822 --> 01:21:50.947
Shit.

01:21:51.991 --> 01:21:54.492
Hey, Mrs. Kaludis.

01:21:54.577 --> 01:21:56.202
Um, is Freddy home?

01:21:58.247 --> 01:22:01.874
I'm Matt Farrell
and this is, uh... Billy.

01:22:03.168 --> 01:22:06.170
We're friends from space camp.

01:22:06.255 --> 01:22:08.089
We went to space camp with Freddy.

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:10.675
Freddy!

01:22:11.677 --> 01:22:12.927
Freddy?

01:22:13.012 --> 01:22:14.345
You got company.

01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:23.980
Frederick, didn't you hear me?

01:22:24.064 --> 01:22:26.107
All Baltimore heard you, Ma.

01:22:26.191 --> 01:22:27.942
Your friends are here.

01:22:28.027 --> 01:22:29.402
WARLOCK:
Friends? What... what the...?

01:22:29.486 --> 01:22:31.112
Come on, Ma!

01:22:31.196 --> 01:22:32.614
How many times I got to tell you

01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:34.115
don't bring people down here, man?

01:22:34.199 --> 01:22:36.576
I can't see too good. Is that
a young bearded Han Solo?

01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:39.162
What happened, man?
You lost so much weight.

01:22:39.246 --> 01:22:40.622
No, dude, I gained 30 pounds.
Who is that?

01:22:40.706 --> 01:22:42.457
- Oh, that's...
- You know what? Doesn't matter.

01:22:42.541 --> 01:22:44.542
Dude, what are you even doing here?
'Cause ofyou, I am rockin'

01:22:44.627 --> 01:22:47.295
five generatorsjust
so I can stay online.

01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:48.963
And since you're being
hunted by assassins,

01:22:49.048 --> 01:22:51.799
it doesn't really make me
think, like, this visit

01:22:51.884 --> 01:22:54.385
is a very productive or
healthy use of my time, and...

01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:55.887
Hey, hey, don't
touch that, all right?

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:57.847
C.B. radio?

01:22:57.931 --> 01:22:59.932
A little low-tech foryou guys,
isn't it?

01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:03.895
Low-tech— dude, that, my friend,
is an end-of-the-world insurance system, okay?

01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:05.563
So when the last
microchip goes down,

01:23:05.648 --> 01:23:07.815
I'm gonna be able to stay in touch
with whoever's out there,

01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:10.193
whether they be zombies or not,
l'll tell you that right now.

01:23:10.277 --> 01:23:12.528
What'd you bring your dad here for?!

01:23:12.613 --> 01:23:16.741
- He's cool; he's into the whole gaming culture...
- Nice poster.

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:18.826
What, like,
you a big fan of the Fett?

01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:20.578
- Oh, God.
- No.

01:23:20.663 --> 01:23:23.206
I was always more
of a Star Wars guy.

01:23:23.290 --> 01:23:24.832
- Star Wars guy.
- Oh, he's kidding.

01:23:24.917 --> 01:23:26.668
- Who is this man?!
- He's my...

01:23:26.752 --> 01:23:28.336
Hey, dump truck, I'm not his dad.

01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:30.630
I'm a cop.
How about that?

01:23:30.714 --> 01:23:33.299
Oh, a cop, I'm sorry.
Thankyou very much.

01:23:33.384 --> 01:23:36.511
Why'd you bring a cop
into my command center?!

01:23:36.595 --> 01:23:38.012
Command center.

01:23:38.097 --> 01:23:39.722
- It's a basement.
- It's a command center.

01:23:39.807 --> 01:23:41.516
Don't help, McClane.
I can explain.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.810
Just tell us what you know
about Thomas Gabriel, all right?

01:23:43.894 --> 01:23:45.436
That's why we came here.

01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:47.772
Thomas Gabriel. That's cool.
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:49.357
Get out— I want you out right now!

01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:50.900
- Why?
- Hey, hey.

01:23:50.984 --> 01:23:53.403
- 'Cause!
-Just calm down, big boy.

01:23:53.487 --> 01:23:55.279
You calm down!
This is my house.

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:57.365
You're going to tell me
what l want to know,

01:23:57.449 --> 01:24:00.618
or I'm going to beat you
to death in your own house.

01:24:14.591 --> 01:24:16.718
WARLOCK:
Four years ago, the D.O.D.

01:24:16.802 --> 01:24:19.554
recruits Thomas Gabriel to be
a cyber-spook for them, okay?

01:24:19.638 --> 01:24:21.556
First day on thejob,
goes in to his bosses

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:25.393
and tells them this nation's security
infrastructure is wide open to compromise,

01:24:25.477 --> 01:24:27.854
and what do they say?
"We'll take it under advisement."

01:24:27.938 --> 01:24:30.648
But this dude don't ease up,
'cause he's committed, like you read about,

01:24:30.733 --> 01:24:33.693
so he breaks into a meeting
oftheJoint Chiers ofStaff, okay?

01:24:33.777 --> 01:24:36.738
And usingjust a laptop,
hacks into NORAD

01:24:36.822 --> 01:24:38.656
and shuts down our
entire defense network,

01:24:38.741 --> 01:24:40.825
till they put a gun
to the man's head

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:42.618
and forced him to stop the hack.

01:24:42.703 --> 01:24:46.080
Thomas Gabriel's the guy who shut down
NORAD with a laptopjust to prove a point.

01:24:46.165 --> 01:24:49.250
- You think I'm scared ofyou?
-Just tell us how to find the guy, that's all.

01:24:49.334 --> 01:24:52.420
How do I know how to find the guy?
He's a ghost, man; hejust fell offthe grid.

01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:53.421
Another dead-end.

01:24:53.505 --> 01:24:54.797
- Come on.
- Hold on, wait, McClane.

01:24:54.882 --> 01:24:57.592
Listen, Warlock, a couple
ofweeks ago, I wrote...

01:24:57.676 --> 01:24:59.552
I know, dude, you
wrote a mutating

01:24:59.636 --> 01:25:01.095
algorithmic security code

01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:04.015
that's probably being used
by Thomas Gabriel right now.

01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:05.600
No, we know that, yes.

01:25:05.684 --> 01:25:06.976
Can you tell us
what he's using it for?

01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:08.936
I don't know. I've been
trying to figure that out.

01:25:09.021 --> 01:25:11.230
Here, look.

01:25:11.315 --> 01:25:14.484
The only security system
in the country that I can find

01:25:14.568 --> 01:25:16.903
currently employing
that particular template

01:25:16.987 --> 01:25:19.071
is the Social Security
Administration, okay?

01:25:19.156 --> 01:25:21.324
But they don't even use it
in the main facility. Look.

01:25:21.408 --> 01:25:23.409
They use it in this building.

01:25:23.494 --> 01:25:24.494
Over here in Woodlawn.

01:25:24.578 --> 01:25:27.705
- Ooh. What the hell? God.
- I know, right?

01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:30.458
"Right," what?
What the hell are you guys talking about?

01:25:30.542 --> 01:25:32.376
- The power consumption is offthe charts.
- It's hot.

01:25:32.461 --> 01:25:34.712
- Why would there be chilling towers there?
- That's what I thought.

01:25:34.797 --> 01:25:36.756
Ho.

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.591
What's a chilling tower?

01:25:39.426 --> 01:25:41.844
See what I've been dealing with?

01:25:41.929 --> 01:25:45.515
Large server farms generate
a lot of heat and need to be cooled.

01:25:45.599 --> 01:25:47.016
But why there?

01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:49.352
Tell you what, guys.
I don't know what's in that building,

01:25:49.436 --> 01:25:52.021
but I assure you it's not
Social Security numbers.

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:58.986
I got a red flag over here.

01:25:59.071 --> 01:26:02.573
Someone's hacking into Woodlawn.

01:26:02.658 --> 01:26:05.409
Honing in on the host server right now.

01:26:06.703 --> 01:26:08.955
Frederick Kaludis.

01:26:09.039 --> 01:26:10.498
Let's have a look at him.

01:26:10.582 --> 01:26:11.791
Fat bastard.

01:26:16.755 --> 01:26:18.130
McClane.

01:26:18.215 --> 01:26:19.882
Where is his daughter?

01:26:19.967 --> 01:26:21.843
Wejust got a trace on her cell.

01:26:21.927 --> 01:26:24.345
You're going to love this.

01:26:27.808 --> 01:26:31.269
All right, let's get
a better look at you.

01:26:43.365 --> 01:26:45.241
- GABRIEL: Freddy.
- What?

01:26:45.325 --> 01:26:48.953
What the hell are you doing
dicking around inside my network?

01:26:52.457 --> 01:26:54.333
GABRIEL:
McClane?

01:26:54.418 --> 01:26:56.502
I thought I killed you already.

01:26:56.587 --> 01:26:59.797
I get that sometimes.

01:27:01.842 --> 01:27:05.428
You think you can, uh,
find a track where he is?

01:27:05.512 --> 01:27:06.596
- Two minutes.
- GABRIEL: Detective,

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:08.890
covering the camera
with your hand

01:27:08.974 --> 01:27:11.809
does not turn offthe microphone.

01:27:11.894 --> 01:27:15.271
Yeah... I know I'm not
as smart as you guys

01:27:15.355 --> 01:27:18.024
at all this computer shit.

01:27:18.108 --> 01:27:19.400
But, hey...

01:27:19.484 --> 01:27:22.111
I'm still alive, ain't I?

01:27:22.195 --> 01:27:27.241
I mean, you've got to be running
out of bad guys by now, right?

01:27:27.326 --> 01:27:28.618
Huh?

01:27:30.329 --> 01:27:32.538
Gabriel?

01:27:34.917 --> 01:27:36.000
Honestly, you can tell me.

01:27:36.084 --> 01:27:38.294
I mean, how does that work?

01:27:38.378 --> 01:27:40.504
Got some kind
ofservice or something?

01:27:40.589 --> 01:27:43.215
Some kind of800 number?
1 -800-HENCHMEN?

01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:45.301
Oh, you know what?
I bet you're still on hold

01:27:45.385 --> 01:27:47.929
with "Can I get another dead
Asian hooker bitch

01:27:48.013 --> 01:27:50.431
over here right away?"

01:27:50.515 --> 01:27:53.643
Huh? But seriously,
all that kicking aside,

01:27:53.727 --> 01:27:57.313
that skinny little ninja chick,
she was smokin' hot.

01:27:57.397 --> 01:28:00.107
A new one ofthose gonna be
real hard to come by, right?

01:28:00.192 --> 01:28:02.818
You're very impressed
with yourself, aren't you?

01:28:02.903 --> 01:28:04.445
I have my moments.

01:28:04.529 --> 01:28:07.239
Yeah?

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:10.117
Is this one ofthem?

01:28:13.246 --> 01:28:15.081
LUCY:
Hello?

01:28:15.165 --> 01:28:18.918
- Yes, this is emergency services calling.
- Oh, thank God.

01:28:19.002 --> 01:28:21.504
- Can she hear me?
- My name is Lucy Gennero.
I've been stuck for hours.

01:28:21.588 --> 01:28:23.422
- I've been trying to call...
- Hey.

01:28:23.507 --> 01:28:26.175
Can she hear this?
Lucy, hang up that phone.

01:28:26.259 --> 01:28:27.677
Yes. Calm down, miss.

01:28:27.761 --> 01:28:29.845
We know exactly where you are.

01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:31.305
Everything is going to be all right.

01:28:31.390 --> 01:28:33.015
Lucy, hang up the phone!

01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:37.061
Please, John, I'm trying
to have a conversation.

01:28:39.815 --> 01:28:42.108
We're a bit overloaded tonight,
as you may imagine,

01:28:42.192 --> 01:28:45.444
but I assure you, we're going
to get you out ofthere,

01:28:45.529 --> 01:28:47.905
even if I have to come down
there and get you myself.

01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:49.824
Thankyou.

01:28:49.908 --> 01:28:51.617
In the meantime, Miss Gennero,
is there anyone

01:28:51.702 --> 01:28:53.536
you would like us
to contact foryou?

01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:55.287
LUCY:
Yeah.

01:28:55.372 --> 01:28:58.165
My dad.

01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:00.001
His name isJohn McClane.

01:29:00.085 --> 01:29:02.169
He's a New York City cop.

01:29:02.254 --> 01:29:04.296
We'll find him.

01:29:04.381 --> 01:29:05.631
Just hang in there, miss.

01:29:05.716 --> 01:29:08.551
We'll get to you... very soon.

01:29:10.637 --> 01:29:13.639
Thank you.

01:29:13.724 --> 01:29:16.851
Wow. That's a great girl
you got there.

01:29:16.935 --> 01:29:18.519
Can't wait to meet her.

01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:19.895
What's the matter?

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:21.522
Cat got your tongue?

01:29:21.606 --> 01:29:24.525
Come on,John.

01:29:24.609 --> 01:29:26.861
Make a joke.

01:29:26.945 --> 01:29:30.614
Say something funny.

01:29:35.829 --> 01:29:37.288
Where are you go...
Wh-Wh...

01:29:37.372 --> 01:29:39.040
Where are you going? Hey.

01:29:39.124 --> 01:29:40.875
FARRELL:
McClane! Hey!

01:29:40.959 --> 01:29:42.001
Hold up. Hold on.

01:29:42.085 --> 01:29:44.045
Where you going?
What are you gonna do?

01:29:44.129 --> 01:29:45.838
What do you think I'm going to do?

01:29:45.922 --> 01:29:48.299
I'm going to go kill this guy
and get my daughter.

01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:50.092
- But she could be anywhere.
- Listen to me.

01:29:50.177 --> 01:29:51.469
It's going to get messy.

01:29:51.553 --> 01:29:52.470
You should just stay here.

01:29:52.554 --> 01:29:53.929
I think I...

01:29:54.014 --> 01:29:56.223
Hey, I'm doing you a favor.

01:29:56.308 --> 01:29:57.767
I wouldn't bet on me, all right?

01:29:58.810 --> 01:30:00.436
I'll take it from here.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:03.189
Thanks foryour help.

01:30:09.696 --> 01:30:13.282
I wouldn't bet on you, either,
so I figured I'd lend a hand.

01:30:14.659 --> 01:30:16.577
Buckle up.

01:30:43.396 --> 01:30:45.731
F.B.I., ma'am, Jersey field office.

01:30:45.816 --> 01:30:47.525
Mind if I see your I.D.?

01:30:47.609 --> 01:30:49.610
Not at all.

01:30:58.703 --> 01:31:00.454
My dad's a cop.

01:31:00.539 --> 01:31:01.705
Force of habit.

01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:05.876
Your father sounds like
a very smart man.

01:31:09.714 --> 01:31:11.632
Kid, can you get Bowman?

01:31:11.716 --> 01:31:13.384
Uh, yeah.

01:31:24.187 --> 01:31:25.813
It's completely dead.

01:31:25.897 --> 01:31:27.606
Gabriel must have shut down

01:31:27.691 --> 01:31:28.816
all the satellite links.

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:30.234
Shit.

01:31:34.531 --> 01:31:37.575
I'm sorry about Lucy, man.

01:31:40.078 --> 01:31:42.830
About all of it.

01:31:42.914 --> 01:31:44.373
It's my fault you got into this.

01:31:44.457 --> 01:31:45.833
This wasn't your fight.

01:31:45.917 --> 01:31:47.459
You got nothing to be sorry about.

01:31:52.591 --> 01:31:54.049
Let go of me, you bastard.

01:31:54.134 --> 01:31:56.260
This bitch is a handful.

01:32:01.474 --> 01:32:03.100
Are you gonna be all right?

01:32:05.604 --> 01:32:07.354
Hey... behave...

01:32:07.439 --> 01:32:08.522
or I will hurt you.

01:32:08.607 --> 01:32:09.982
Oh, yeah?

01:32:10.066 --> 01:32:11.942
Let's step outside,just you and me.

01:32:12.027 --> 01:32:13.736
We'll see who hurts who.

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:17.698
You really are his daughter.

01:32:17.782 --> 01:32:19.742
Tie her wrists.

01:32:26.416 --> 01:32:27.917
Trey.

01:32:28.001 --> 01:32:29.126
Gabriel wants to see you.

01:32:29.211 --> 01:32:30.377
Is it that time already?

01:32:30.462 --> 01:32:31.837
Yeah.

01:32:31.922 --> 01:32:34.465
Okay.

01:32:35.467 --> 01:32:37.843
I'll be back in a second.

01:32:43.099 --> 01:32:45.017
No, no, no, please, please!

01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:30.938
We're showing a breach

01:33:31.022 --> 01:33:33.023
on an exterior vent.

01:33:36.695 --> 01:33:39.655
Go take a look.

01:33:39.739 --> 01:33:42.533
Don't be long.
We're packing up soon.

01:33:53.712 --> 01:33:55.629
Hey, McClane.

01:33:55.714 --> 01:33:57.881
Do we have anything resembling
a plan or anything?

01:33:57.966 --> 01:33:59.967
Find Lucy and kill everybody else.

01:34:00.051 --> 01:34:03.387
I mean more like a plan,
like a way to do that.

01:34:05.307 --> 01:34:07.808
Come on.

01:34:09.185 --> 01:34:10.936
Okay, according to the layout,

01:34:11.021 --> 01:34:13.272
uh, the chilling towers
are kept on the bottom level.

01:34:18.903 --> 01:34:20.738
I think mine's locked.

01:34:25.368 --> 01:34:28.954
Okay, now it looks like
we're getting somewhere.

01:34:35.712 --> 01:34:37.046
Uh...

01:34:39.966 --> 01:34:41.342
Okay, this looks like

01:34:41.426 --> 01:34:43.344
it controls the cooling system
for the mainframe,

01:34:43.428 --> 01:34:46.305
which should be...

01:34:46.389 --> 01:34:50.392
If I can just hack in...

01:34:50.477 --> 01:34:53.354
...trip the alarm,
it might alert Bowman.

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:02.863
Someone set offthe alarms.

01:35:02.947 --> 01:35:04.698
Yes. Thankyou, detective.

01:35:04.783 --> 01:35:05.908
I can hear that.

01:35:05.992 --> 01:35:07.826
Find a way to turn it off.

01:35:11.456 --> 01:35:13.874
What do you got?

01:35:13.958 --> 01:35:16.085
We got a problem.

01:35:16.169 --> 01:35:18.545
The alarms went offat Woodlawn.

01:35:18.630 --> 01:35:21.048
It's got to be him.

01:35:21.132 --> 01:35:24.009
And what's Woodlawn?

01:35:27.472 --> 01:35:29.431
It's N.S.A.,

01:35:29.516 --> 01:35:32.267
a secure facility
outside of Baltimore.

01:35:32.352 --> 01:35:34.561
It's a fail-safe
we built after 9/1 1

01:35:34.646 --> 01:35:36.438
to back up
all financial information.

01:35:36.523 --> 01:35:38.399
The moment the networks
were hit,

01:35:38.483 --> 01:35:39.900
all the financial data

01:35:39.984 --> 01:35:41.068
automatically
began downloading

01:35:41.152 --> 01:35:42.861
to those servers.

01:35:42.946 --> 01:35:44.988
Banks, Wall Street,
corporate records,

01:35:45.073 --> 01:35:46.240
government funds,

01:35:46.324 --> 01:35:48.450
all of it, basically,
a backup

01:35:48.535 --> 01:35:51.286
for the accumulated wealth
ofAmerica.

01:35:51.371 --> 01:35:52.830
All in one location?

01:35:54.666 --> 01:35:56.583
What could Gabriel do with it?

01:35:56.668 --> 01:35:59.002
Well, if he could get in, he
might try to transfer the data

01:35:59.087 --> 01:36:00.629
to a portable hard drive;

01:36:00.713 --> 01:36:03.715
then he could have access to
those accounts from anywhere,

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:06.301
siphon off billions for himself.

01:36:06.386 --> 01:36:08.262
We'd have no way to trace it.

01:36:08.346 --> 01:36:11.014
Or knowing him,
he could erase it all

01:36:11.099 --> 01:36:13.142
and send us all
back to the Stone Age.

01:36:13.226 --> 01:36:16.270
Why the hell
wasn't I told about this?

01:36:16.354 --> 01:36:18.105
Frankly, uh,

01:36:18.189 --> 01:36:19.773
it's above your pay grade.

01:36:19.858 --> 01:36:21.942
My pay grade?

01:36:23.236 --> 01:36:24.987
How the hell
did Gabriel

01:36:25.071 --> 01:36:27.156
find out about this, when
even I didn't know about it?

01:36:31.453 --> 01:36:34.037
He designed it.

01:36:35.039 --> 01:36:37.332
It was his program.

01:36:37.417 --> 01:36:39.626
He knew that hacking
your system last night

01:36:39.711 --> 01:36:41.462
would trigger the download.

01:36:41.546 --> 01:36:44.381
That's brilliant.

01:36:44.466 --> 01:36:48.343
You two geniuses stay out of my way.

01:36:53.391 --> 01:36:55.934
FARRELL:
Let me see if I can get a floor plan ofthis place.

01:36:56.019 --> 01:36:58.812
- Okay...
- Don't move!

01:36:58.897 --> 01:37:02.483
You— get away from the bag.
Now!

01:37:02.567 --> 01:37:04.651
Okay. Okay.

01:37:04.736 --> 01:37:06.236
We've been waiting foryou.

01:37:06.321 --> 01:37:08.447
Yeah?

01:37:08.531 --> 01:37:10.741
I've been waiting foryou, too.

01:37:38.102 --> 01:37:42.856
McClane!

01:37:44.943 --> 01:37:46.860
Kid!

01:37:46.945 --> 01:37:48.320
Matt!

01:37:48.404 --> 01:37:49.530
Kid?!

01:38:02.502 --> 01:38:05.087
Emerson.

01:38:05.171 --> 01:38:08.465
We seem to have a problem
in one ofthe cooling towers.

01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:09.925
- Tower Seven.
- Tower Seven.

01:38:10.009 --> 01:38:12.719
- Find out what's going on.
- Okay.

01:38:21.813 --> 01:38:23.855
- Sir?
- Get the H.R. team to stand by.

01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:25.399
We need to get to Woodlawn now.

01:38:25.483 --> 01:38:27.734
The roads out are completely blocked.
D.C. is in total gridlock.

01:38:27.819 --> 01:38:30.237
Well, get us some helicopters.

01:38:30.321 --> 01:38:33.907
Sir, they've all been pulled
by the Pentagon for search and rescue.

01:38:33.992 --> 01:38:37.286
Molina, find me some goddamn
helicopters immediately.

01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:41.582
Look, the Pentagon hasjets flying CAP over D.C.
Have them send one over to Woodlawn

01:38:41.666 --> 01:38:44.001
and keep an eye on things
till we get there.

01:38:44.085 --> 01:38:45.419
Let's go.

01:38:56.848 --> 01:38:58.432
Where's my daughter?

01:38:58.516 --> 01:39:01.059
Russo, check in.

01:39:04.814 --> 01:39:05.856
Yeah, I think, uh...

01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:07.441
Russo's on his way down

01:39:07.525 --> 01:39:09.943
to meet your girlfriend, dickhead.

01:39:10.028 --> 01:39:11.194
Hold on a minute.

01:39:11.279 --> 01:39:13.447
Looks like he's coming around.

01:39:13.531 --> 01:39:15.616
It's McClane. He's on the
third floor and the kid is...

01:39:19.704 --> 01:39:21.788
McCLANE:
Get all that?

01:39:21.873 --> 01:39:23.540
That's right.

01:39:23.625 --> 01:39:27.210
l'm on the third floor,
but I'm coming to get you.

01:39:35.803 --> 01:39:38.263
Don't move now.
I'll send a doctor.

01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:43.935
Kill this guy and I'll
give you Mai's cut.

01:39:53.655 --> 01:39:55.280
Shit.

01:40:30.316 --> 01:40:32.275
My algorithm.

01:40:38.282 --> 01:40:39.408
Okay, please get in.

01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:43.328
Oh, please. God.

01:41:18.281 --> 01:41:22.242
Oh,Jesus, they're going
after the money.

01:41:45.433 --> 01:41:47.601
GABRIEL:
You coming to get me,John?

01:41:47.685 --> 01:41:48.769
Is that the plan?

01:41:48.853 --> 01:41:50.645
Yep. That's my plan.

01:41:50.730 --> 01:41:53.231
What makes you think I won't put
a bullet in your daughter's head

01:41:53.316 --> 01:41:54.483
right now?

01:41:54.567 --> 01:41:56.151
- 'Cause you're scared of me.
- Is that right?

01:41:56.235 --> 01:41:57.444
You think I'm afraid ofyou?

01:41:57.528 --> 01:42:00.155
'Cause otherwise
she'd be dead already.

01:42:00.239 --> 01:42:01.490
You need a bargaining chip.

01:42:08.748 --> 01:42:10.916
Stop there.
Hands up.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.752
Ifyou kill me, you'll
never get it open.

01:42:15.963 --> 01:42:17.422
Move away.

01:42:17.507 --> 01:42:18.632
Move!

01:42:25.556 --> 01:42:27.140
You know,John,

01:42:27.225 --> 01:42:29.142
I feel like we've gotten off
on the wrong foot.

01:42:29.227 --> 01:42:31.478
And because ofthat,

01:42:31.562 --> 01:42:34.815
you think l'm the bad guy,
and nothing could be

01:42:34.899 --> 01:42:36.817
further from the truth:
I'm the good guy here.

01:42:36.901 --> 01:42:39.402
I told them this could happen
ifthey didn't prepare.

01:42:39.487 --> 01:42:40.904
Did I get a thank-you?

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:42.239
No, I got crucified.

01:42:42.323 --> 01:42:43.782
But they wouldn't listen.

01:42:43.866 --> 01:42:45.325
You got their attention now,

01:42:45.409 --> 01:42:47.327
- don't you?
- That's right.

01:42:47.411 --> 01:42:50.914
I am doing the country a favor.

01:42:50.998 --> 01:42:53.375
By tearing it apart.

01:42:53.459 --> 01:42:54.668
Better me than some outsider,

01:42:54.752 --> 01:42:58.630
some religious nutjob
bent on Armageddon.

01:42:58.714 --> 01:43:00.674
Nobody wants to see that happen.

01:43:00.758 --> 01:43:03.844
Everything I've broken
can be fixed...

01:43:03.928 --> 01:43:06.847
ifthe country is willing
to pay for it.

01:43:06.931 --> 01:43:08.223
Ah, bullshit.

01:43:08.307 --> 01:43:10.934
It's always been about the money.

01:43:11.018 --> 01:43:12.894
What, I shouldn't get paid
for my work?

01:43:12.979 --> 01:43:14.688
I'm working my ass off here,John.

01:43:14.772 --> 01:43:17.941
Well,just sit tight, asshole.
l got a check foryou.

01:43:21.237 --> 01:43:22.362
I can't talk to this guy.

01:43:22.446 --> 01:43:24.781
You talk to him, see if
you can get him to focus.

01:43:26.033 --> 01:43:27.450
Dad?

01:43:30.162 --> 01:43:32.163
Hi, baby.

01:43:32.248 --> 01:43:34.165
Now there are only five ofthem.

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:40.005
Hang on, Lucy. I'm coming.

01:43:50.224 --> 01:43:53.393
Would somebody please
kill this son ofa bitch?

01:43:55.187 --> 01:43:57.272
We have a problem.

01:43:57.356 --> 01:43:58.440
No, there's...

01:43:58.524 --> 01:43:59.733
there's actually no problem.

01:43:59.817 --> 01:44:02.027
I think I just got off
on the wrong floor.

01:44:04.155 --> 01:44:05.697
TREY:
This is a mess.

01:44:09.201 --> 01:44:10.785
Wow, I'm... I'm truly
impressed, man.

01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:12.203
Hacking every byte

01:44:12.288 --> 01:44:14.372
offinancial data for the
entire country would take weeks

01:44:14.457 --> 01:44:15.832
unless you eliminated
the congestion.

01:44:17.043 --> 01:44:19.669
That's what this
fire sale's about, isn't it?

01:44:19.754 --> 01:44:21.671
That's brilliant.

01:44:21.756 --> 01:44:23.798
Yes, it is.
Please be quiet.

01:44:23.883 --> 01:44:25.216
Asshole.

01:44:25.301 --> 01:44:26.343
Who are you?

01:44:26.427 --> 01:44:28.553
Matt Farrell.

01:44:28.638 --> 01:44:30.430
Lucy McClane.

01:44:30.514 --> 01:44:33.099
I thought your name was Gennero.

01:44:33.184 --> 01:44:35.435
Lucy Gennero.

01:44:35.519 --> 01:44:37.145
Not today.

01:44:37.229 --> 01:44:38.772
Can you crack the code?

01:44:38.856 --> 01:44:41.232
Maybe, I mean, if I had enough time.

01:44:41.317 --> 01:44:43.360
That's encouraging.

01:44:44.695 --> 01:44:46.237
Take them with us.

01:44:47.615 --> 01:44:49.699
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

01:44:52.286 --> 01:44:54.454
Gabriel, Pentagon just
sent an F-35 towards us.

01:44:54.538 --> 01:44:56.206
Keep an eye on it.

01:44:58.125 --> 01:45:00.585
Pulling down the go codes now.

01:45:17.728 --> 01:45:20.605
You might want to start thinking about
what you want on your headstone, asshole.

01:45:27.071 --> 01:45:28.989
Christ.

01:45:29.073 --> 01:45:30.615
Goddamn hamster.

01:45:31.325 --> 01:45:32.742
Here you go.

01:45:32.827 --> 01:45:35.286
Stay still, spider boy.

01:45:39.291 --> 01:45:41.084
That's right.

01:46:10.156 --> 01:46:11.448
Goddamn it!

01:46:21.208 --> 01:46:22.375
Oh-ho-ho, no.

01:46:24.545 --> 01:46:26.588
Seriously, you probably
shouldn't antagonize them

01:46:26.672 --> 01:46:29.299
since they have all
the loaded guns and whatnot.

01:46:29.383 --> 01:46:30.717
Listen, will you
just take a minute

01:46:30.801 --> 01:46:32.552
and dig deep for
a bigger set of balls,

01:46:32.636 --> 01:46:34.220
'cause you're gonna need
them before we're through.

01:46:34.305 --> 01:46:35.638
Wow, I know that tone.

01:46:35.723 --> 01:46:38.975
lt'sjust weird hearing it
come from someone... with hair.

01:47:14.678 --> 01:47:15.804
Sir.

01:47:15.888 --> 01:47:19.557
E.T.A.: 1 5 minutes.

01:48:11.318 --> 01:48:13.528
Fix it.

01:48:13.612 --> 01:48:17.240
Oh, why? You'rejust going to
kill me if I fix it. I know that.

01:48:24.456 --> 01:48:26.499
Shit.

01:48:29.753 --> 01:48:31.129
I'm not gonna do it.

01:48:36.343 --> 01:48:38.261
Oh, no, no, no. Shit.

01:48:38.345 --> 01:48:41.514
- Robinson is coming pretty fast.
- I'm sorry. What?

01:48:41.599 --> 01:48:43.600
Something's wrong.
Robinson is coming too fast.

01:48:48.856 --> 01:48:50.273
TREY:
It's not Robinson.

01:48:50.357 --> 01:48:52.817
That would be my dad.

01:49:03.871 --> 01:49:06.039
Freddy.

01:49:06.123 --> 01:49:08.458
Freddy!

01:49:10.252 --> 01:49:12.337
It's John McClane.
Look, I know you can hear me.

01:49:12.421 --> 01:49:15.381
This is your frequency, right?
666.

01:49:15.466 --> 01:49:17.258
Come on.
Pick up the mike, Freddy.

01:49:20.304 --> 01:49:22.931
Uh, nobody here by that name, sorry.

01:49:23.015 --> 01:49:25.058
Hacker jerkoff!

01:49:29.104 --> 01:49:31.522
Warlock...

01:49:31.607 --> 01:49:33.233
I need you to do

01:49:33.317 --> 01:49:36.569
whatever it is you do to
patch me through to the F.B.I.,

01:49:36.654 --> 01:49:38.905
to Deputy Director Bowman.

01:49:38.989 --> 01:49:40.156
You hear me?

01:49:40.241 --> 01:49:41.574
Are you serious?

01:49:41.659 --> 01:49:43.701
You want me to intentionally
open up a comm line

01:49:43.786 --> 01:49:46.621
to the head ofthe F.B.I. cyber
division? I don't think so.

01:49:48.165 --> 01:49:50.750
Freddy, goddamn it.
They have my daughter.

01:49:55.714 --> 01:49:58.258
I can do that. Hold on.

01:49:58.342 --> 01:50:00.635
Thank you.

01:50:07.977 --> 01:50:11.396
This is Central. We have
a patch for Director Bowman.

01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:14.857
Sir, Central's trying to reach you.

01:50:16.318 --> 01:50:17.235
Go.

01:50:17.319 --> 01:50:18.736
Bowman, it's McClane.

01:50:18.821 --> 01:50:21.114
- McClane.
- Listen to me.

01:50:21.198 --> 01:50:23.741
Gabriel is on the 695 headed
north in a hazmat truck.

01:50:23.826 --> 01:50:26.035
BOWMAN:
Wait, Gabriel has left Woodlawn?

01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:27.704
We're headed there right now.

01:50:27.788 --> 01:50:29.747
And, Bowman, he's got my daughter.

01:50:31.041 --> 01:50:33.334
Listen, this hazmat truck

01:50:33.419 --> 01:50:36.004
is a government vehicle,
so it should be LoJacked, right?

01:50:36.088 --> 01:50:38.548
Track that down, it should
take you right to them.

01:50:38.632 --> 01:50:39.674
Give me the tag number.

01:50:39.758 --> 01:50:40.925
All right, hang on.

01:50:41.010 --> 01:50:41.968
Here it comes.

01:50:42.052 --> 01:50:44.971
Golf-Tango...

01:50:45.055 --> 01:50:50.101
five-niner-two-November.

01:50:50.185 --> 01:50:52.812
Yeah, got it.
McClane, where is Farrell?

01:50:52.896 --> 01:50:54.439
He's with them.

01:50:54.523 --> 01:50:56.816
Listen to me.

01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:59.485
I'm going to go in there
and get Lucy out,

01:50:59.570 --> 01:51:01.404
but ifsomething happens to me,

01:51:01.488 --> 01:51:03.448
you got to send the cavalry in,
you hear me?

01:51:03.532 --> 01:51:05.491
I mean everybody.

01:51:05.576 --> 01:51:08.286
Don't let that maniac get
my daughter, you hear me?

01:51:08.370 --> 01:51:09.954
John, don't worry.

01:51:10.039 --> 01:51:11.789
I want your word, Bowman.

01:51:13.584 --> 01:51:15.001
Yeah, you have it.

01:51:15.085 --> 01:51:18.421
McClane out.

01:51:25.637 --> 01:51:26.763
There's the F-35.

01:51:28.891 --> 01:51:31.225
Did you get the go codes?

01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:34.187
- Trey! Did you get the go codes?
- Yes, yeah, I got the go codes.

01:51:34.271 --> 01:51:35.813
Can you connect me to the pilot?

01:51:35.898 --> 01:51:36.939
Uh...

01:51:38.067 --> 01:51:38.816
Uh... uh...

01:51:52.539 --> 01:51:55.041
Isolating his radio.

01:52:00.547 --> 01:52:02.465
Sending him the go codes.

01:52:09.848 --> 01:52:11.099
AV-81 .

01:52:11.183 --> 01:52:15.186
AV-81 , this is marine
airwing A.T.C.

01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:17.271
Go for AV-81 .

01:52:17.356 --> 01:52:18.731
Confirmed terrorist vehicle
has been located

01:52:18.816 --> 01:52:20.274
in your sector: big rig truck.

01:52:21.735 --> 01:52:23.069
GABRIEL:
Currently in pursuit ofa hazmat vehicle.

01:52:23.153 --> 01:52:24.612
PILOT:
I see them, A.T.C.

01:52:24.696 --> 01:52:27.532
You are authorized
to engage and destroy.

01:52:27.616 --> 01:52:29.992
Copy that. AV-81 engaging.

01:52:38.293 --> 01:52:39.419
What?

01:52:47.344 --> 01:52:49.512
Jesus Christ!

01:52:49.596 --> 01:52:50.555
Goddamn it!

01:52:53.642 --> 01:52:55.518
You're shooting at the wrong guy!

01:53:03.527 --> 01:53:05.862
I don't think daddy's coming, honey.

01:53:17.833 --> 01:53:20.585
Hey! Jackass!

01:54:08.050 --> 01:54:10.843
Is that it?! Huh?!

01:54:12.763 --> 01:54:15.056
Is that your best shot?!

01:54:58.475 --> 01:55:00.017
Come on!

01:55:26.295 --> 01:55:28.004
Come on!

01:56:27.397 --> 01:56:29.398
Whew.

01:57:01.306 --> 01:57:02.473
Let's go! Come on!

01:57:02.557 --> 01:57:05.601
- Got two more to go.
- That way. That way. Go.

01:57:05.686 --> 01:57:08.104
Let's go. Move it.

01:57:14.361 --> 01:57:17.363
We are leaving in three minutes.

01:57:19.866 --> 01:57:22.868
You have one.

01:57:22.953 --> 01:57:24.078
The rules haven't changed, man.

01:57:24.162 --> 01:57:25.705
You're gonna kill me
the minute I unlock it.

01:57:30.335 --> 01:57:34.255
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit...
- Matthew? Matthew!

01:57:34.339 --> 01:57:36.215
I really need you to pay attention.

01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:39.343
The rules can always change.

01:57:39.428 --> 01:57:40.344
Okay, wait.

01:57:40.429 --> 01:57:42.054
I'm gonna shoot her in ten seconds.

01:57:42.139 --> 01:57:43.514
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:57:43.598 --> 01:57:46.559
- Nine...
- I can't.

01:57:46.643 --> 01:57:48.060
eight...

01:57:48.145 --> 01:57:51.564
I can't.

01:57:51.648 --> 01:57:53.232
Oh, God...

01:57:55.152 --> 01:57:57.445
Yaah! Okay!

01:57:59.322 --> 01:58:00.823
Okay, okay, okay.

01:58:00.907 --> 01:58:01.907
Six...

01:58:01.992 --> 01:58:04.410
Okay,just stop. Stop, stop.

01:58:04.494 --> 01:58:06.495
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

01:58:06.580 --> 01:58:07.913
FARRELL: Oh, God.

01:58:07.998 --> 01:58:09.206
Oh, my God.

01:58:21.803 --> 01:58:24.346
Feds are headed this way.

01:58:24.431 --> 01:58:26.557
Get everything on the plane.

01:58:35.859 --> 01:58:37.526
- Dad!
- GABRIEL: Careful.

01:58:37.611 --> 01:58:38.819
Don't worry, baby.

01:58:38.904 --> 01:58:41.113
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:58:43.074 --> 01:58:44.658
Daddy!

01:58:51.917 --> 01:58:53.209
Hold this.

01:59:15.607 --> 01:59:16.732
No!

01:59:18.235 --> 01:59:20.736
Jesus Christ.

01:59:21.696 --> 01:59:23.906
You got her?

01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:25.032
You're sure?

01:59:27.869 --> 01:59:29.912
It's a nice effort, though.

01:59:29.996 --> 01:59:31.497
Matthew!

01:59:31.581 --> 01:59:32.456
Oh, shit!

01:59:32.541 --> 01:59:33.666
All right, okay!

01:59:33.750 --> 01:59:35.584
FARRELL:
Okay, I'm doing it. I know.

01:59:43.426 --> 01:59:44.343
McClane.

01:59:45.554 --> 01:59:48.472
Would you do me a favor?

01:59:49.766 --> 01:59:52.268
I know the lights
are beginning to dim,

01:59:52.352 --> 01:59:53.853
but ifyou could just hang on

01:59:53.937 --> 01:59:56.188
for a second, as soon
as Matt's finished,

01:59:56.273 --> 01:59:58.023
I'm gonna kill him
and your daughter,

01:59:58.108 --> 02:00:01.026
and I would love
foryou to see that.

02:00:02.112 --> 02:00:03.988
Goddamn it. Matthew?

02:00:04.072 --> 02:00:07.199
Ten seconds, okay, ten seconds
you'll have all your money.

02:00:07.284 --> 02:00:09.326
You just leave.
No one has to get hurt, okay?

02:00:09.411 --> 02:00:10.828
A few seconds.

02:00:10.912 --> 02:00:11.829
Stay with me.

02:00:11.913 --> 02:00:13.998
McClane!

02:00:16.126 --> 02:00:18.210
- Stay with me.
- Dad?

02:00:18.295 --> 02:00:20.170
On your tombstone,
it should read:

02:00:20.255 --> 02:00:23.465
"Always in the wrong place
at the wrong time."

02:00:24.301 --> 02:00:27.469
How about... "Yippee-ki-yay,

02:00:27.554 --> 02:00:28.971
motherfu..."

02:00:40.650 --> 02:00:42.401
Daddy...

02:00:42.485 --> 02:00:43.652
Daddy...

02:00:43.737 --> 02:00:45.654
Are you okay?

02:00:45.739 --> 02:00:47.531
Yes, baby, I'm fine.

02:00:47.616 --> 02:00:51.201
I knew you would come for me.

02:00:51.286 --> 02:00:52.745
McCLANE:
Ofcourse I'd come foryou.

02:00:52.829 --> 02:00:55.998
Sorry it took me so long. It's okay.

02:01:03.340 --> 02:01:04.506
Move, move!

02:01:09.930 --> 02:01:12.181
AGENT:
Freeze!

02:01:12.265 --> 02:01:13.307
Hold, hold!

02:01:13.391 --> 02:01:15.142
He's okay.

02:01:17.145 --> 02:01:19.146
Move around. Come around!

02:01:19.230 --> 02:01:22.024
- Here, help Daddy up.
- Okay.

02:01:22.108 --> 02:01:23.609
Wait, wait. Oh, wait.

02:01:23.693 --> 02:01:25.444
I think l'll
just stay here

02:01:25.528 --> 02:01:26.862
for a minute.

02:01:26.947 --> 02:01:29.531
Okay. Daddy, you're
out ofyour mind.

02:01:29.616 --> 02:01:31.116
What are you talking about?

02:01:31.201 --> 02:01:32.785
You shot yourself!

02:01:32.869 --> 02:01:35.204
It seemed like a good
idea at the time.

02:01:35.288 --> 02:01:37.414
Don't tell these guys
that I did that.

02:01:50.136 --> 02:01:53.263
- Thanks for all your help, John.
- Thankyou.

02:01:54.307 --> 02:01:56.141
Is he okay?

02:01:58.269 --> 02:02:00.980
- Should I put my hands up?
- No, don't put your hands up.

02:02:01.064 --> 02:02:02.773
- Put 'em down farther?
- Yeah.

02:02:02.857 --> 02:02:05.859
He might die ofshock on
the way to the hospital.

02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:12.157
All right.

02:02:14.536 --> 02:02:16.453
I'll be right back.

02:02:18.164 --> 02:02:19.123
McCLANE:
Hey.

02:02:19.207 --> 02:02:20.332
Oh, hey.

02:02:20.417 --> 02:02:21.333
How's it feel to be shot?

02:02:21.418 --> 02:02:22.668
It actually feels great.

02:02:22.752 --> 02:02:24.670
Uh, he gave me some...
what is it called? Mor...

02:02:24.754 --> 02:02:26.547
- Morphine.
- Morphine.

02:02:26.631 --> 02:02:28.799
Wow, you got your merit badge now.

02:02:28.883 --> 02:02:30.634
Yeah... Hey, I don't
know what that means.

02:02:31.928 --> 02:02:33.846
Plus, you know, chicks dig scars.

02:02:33.930 --> 02:02:36.432
Really? Hm.

02:02:37.559 --> 02:02:39.226
Not that one.

02:02:39.310 --> 02:02:40.519
What?

02:02:40.603 --> 02:02:41.770
Don't even think about it.

02:02:41.855 --> 02:02:43.731
How did you know
what I was thinking?

02:02:43.815 --> 02:02:45.566
Why? Did she say something to you?

02:02:45.650 --> 02:02:47.067
I felt like we had a, um...

02:02:47.152 --> 02:02:48.485
- kind ofa vibe.
- Take it easy.

02:02:48.570 --> 02:02:49.695
That'sjust the morphine kicking in.

02:02:49.779 --> 02:02:51.363
Yeah.

02:02:51.448 --> 02:02:52.865
Besides,

02:02:52.949 --> 02:02:54.366
after all we've
been through,

02:02:54.451 --> 02:02:56.869
I'd hate to have to
beat you to death.

02:02:58.121 --> 02:03:00.664
That would suck.

02:03:00.749 --> 02:03:02.875
Good to go?

02:03:02.959 --> 02:03:04.126
Yeah, we're all set.

02:03:04.210 --> 02:03:05.794
Take care ofyourself.

02:03:05.879 --> 02:03:09.089
I'll see you at the hospital.

02:03:10.633 --> 02:03:12.134
Hey.

02:03:13.636 --> 02:03:16.138
Thanks for saving
my daughter's life.

02:03:16.222 --> 02:03:18.474
Hey...

02:03:18.558 --> 02:03:20.559
what was I gonna do?

02:03:22.729 --> 02:03:25.022
That's what makes you that guy.

02:03:27.901 --> 02:03:30.277
Yeah.

02:03:35.784 --> 02:03:38.660
So, uh, did he say
anything about me?

02:03:40.163 --> 02:03:42.748
Jesus, Lucy!

02:03:42.832 --> 02:03:44.958
What? I-I'm sorry.
I'm just asking.

02:03:46.002 --> 02:03:48.504
I'm in enough pain already.

02:03:48.588 --> 02:03:50.839
Hospital.
